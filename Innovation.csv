It plays a crucial role in the performance and longevity of the tyre, impacting ride comfort, handling, fuel efficiency, and safety. The term ""uniformity"" encompasses several key metrics:Force Variation: Variations in the forces generated by the tyre as it rotates. This includes radial force, lateral force, and axial force, which affect the smoothness of the ride and vehicle handling.Geometric Variation: Variations in the tyre's shape, such as conicity (side-to-side variation) and runout (deviation from a perfect circle).Mass Distribution: Variations in the distribution of weight around the tyre, which may affect balance and stability.Tyres need to meet strict uniformity standards to ensure optimal vehicle performance and comfort. Failure to meet these standards can lead to significant customer dissatisfaction, vehicle performance issues, and financial losses for tyre manufacturers.2. The Importance of OEM Yield in Tyre UniformityFor a tyre manufacturer, meeting Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) specifications is essential for several reasons:OEM Specifications and Customer Expectations: Non-uniform tyres will fail to meet OE specifications, which can lead to poor OE yield and stock up of NOE tyres at warehouse and plantsProductivity Loss because of NOE yield: If a significant portion of the production batch falls below these uniformity standards, it impacts profitability as production efficiency reduces as same amount of NON OE tyres have to produced againFinancial Losses: Non-uniform tyres that do not meet OEM specifications may not be accepted by OEMs and could end up being sold in the aftermarket at a discounted price. Many a times these tyres are not in demand in aftermarket tyres which often command a lower price point, leading to significant losses for the company.3.The Cost of Non-Uniform Tyres and the Potential for SavingsWhen tyres fail to meet OEM specifications, they are typically sold in the aftermarket, often at a discount. This leads to several financial consequences:Revenue LossStorage and Disposal CostsBrand Reputation4. CEAT’s Laser-Based Uniformity Correction SolutionTo address the challenge of uniformity, CEAT has introduced a unique laser-based solution for correcting tyre uniformity. This solution involves the use of laser technology to finely grind the tyre beads, removing any irregularities and ensuring that the tyre meets the desired uniformity standards. For POC : A laser machine has been used to grind the bead at different angles along the bead radial surface at various depth and using data modelling and AI empirical equations have been developed to automatically detect the depth of grinding in upcoming fully automated machine. As of now bulk validations are in progress and project shall be horizontally deployed in Halol and chennai PCR plants in FY 24-25 and FY 25-26.  ",Darwin," Renji Issac (renji.issac@rpg.in), Mukul Bar (mukul.bar@ceat.com)",CEAT,Yes,,No,"Challenges1.

Bottom half of assembly is having lower temperature than top half.  Due to this phenomenon top half of tire gets properly cured, whereas the bottom half of tire is having abnormal curing. This can result in few performances related issues while tire in service like reduced belt & bead durability, uneven wear & reduced tire life. To avoid occurrence of these defects, we need to extend the cure cycle till bottom half also perfectly curedThis situation raised to explore alternatives to have uniform heating of top & bottom halves of green tire during curing process. Team has come out with an innovative segmented mould container design with an additional heating source integrated in container components to heat the last cured area in bottom half of tire.In this innovation, container assembly was redesigned by introducing an additional heat source named as steam chamber in container bottom plate to improve the curing rate in last cured region of tire in bottom half. Introducing new bottom steam plate compensates for heat deficit in the bottom zone of the tire during curing process and temperature difference is eliminated by this design concept. The bottom container plate is having separate inlet & outlet for steam flow and designed with optimal fins to improve the head transfer. These fins help to create a sinusoidal path for the steam to flow and help in create necessary turbulence for efficient heat transfer across the chamber to curing zone.The experimental container design was implemented for a trial production and temperature difference issues was resolved. Additionally, it resulted in benefit of reduction in curing cycle time of ~2-3 mins resulting in capability to produce additional ~220 tires per day resulting in annual business benefit of ~160Cr.",Darwin," Vipul John (vipul.john@ceat.com), Sujith Nair (sujith.nair@ceat.com), Mukul Bar (mukul.bar@ceat.com)",CEAT,Yes,,No,"1.Incorporating

Robots, while capable of performing repetitive tasks, can struggle to match the level of precision provided by human
 inspectors, particularly in complex geometries or micro-level defects. 2. Complexity of Mould GeometriesChallenge: Moulds often have intricate and irregular shapes. Inspecting parts with deep cavities, complex features, or undercuts can be difficult for robots, especially when traditional inspection methods are not feasible. 3. Real-Time Decision MakingChallenge: Mould quality inspection often requires on-the-spot decision making based on detected defects (such as cracks, scratches, or warping). The robot system must not only identify defects but also determine their severity and whether the mould should
 be considered acceptable or rejected. 4. Sensor Integration and Data OverloadChallenge: Robots used for inspection are typically equipped with a variety of sensors such as cameras, lasers, ultrasonic sensors, and touch probes. Integrating these sensors and managing the large volumes of data they generate can be overwhelming. 5. Environmental FactorsChallenge: Factors such as lighting conditions, temperature variations, or humidity can affect sensor readings and make it difficult for robots to consistently perform quality inspections. 6. Adaptability to Different Mould TypesChallenge: In industries like automotive, plastic, or metal injection molding, different mould types and materials are used for various parts. A robot system may require reprogramming or recalibration for different moulds, which can be time-consuming and
 costly. 7. Speed vs. Quality Trade-offChallenge: There's often a trade-off between inspection speed and the level of detail and quality checks performed. While robots can work fast, high-resolution, thorough inspections require more time, potentially slowing down production. 8. Cost of ImplementationChallenge: The cost of setting up a robot-integrated inspection system can be high. This includes the cost of robots, sensors, vision systems, and software development, as well as the need for ongoing maintenance and calibration. 9. Human-Robot CollaborationChallenge: In some cases, robots and humans need to collaborate during the mould inspection process, particularly in situations where robots cannot handle certain tasks. Ensuring safe and effective collaboration requires careful planning. 10. Maintenance and DowntimeChallenge: Robots are complex systems that require regular maintenance, and any downtime can lead to significant delays in production.

 The
     AI fabric for heavy machinery leverages sensor data to enhance
     performance monitoring and predictive maintenance. The primary focus is on
     three core tasks: error reconstruction, anomaly detection,
     and sensor grouping.
 For error
     reconstruction, an attention-based LSTM is employed to
     accurately capture temporal dependencies and dynamic variations in sensor
     signals. The attention mechanism ensures that significant time steps
     receive higher weights, improving the reconstruction of missing or
     corrupted data points.
 Anomaly
     detection is handled using the Isolation Forest algorithm,
     which isolates anomalies by randomly partitioning the dataset. It is
     particularly suited for high-dimensional sensor data, offering robust
     performance in detecting rare and unexpected events.
 Sensor
     grouping is facilitated through Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Agglomerative
     Clustering, allowing the system to group sensors based on their signal
     similarity and temporal alignment. This helps identify correlated sensors,
     leading to more effective monitoring and diagnostics.
 Additionally,
     a Generative AI-based agentic Q&A bot is integrated into the
     system to provide real-time insights and recommendations. The bot
     leverages historical data and model outputs to answer queries related to
     machine health, error reports, and suggested maintenance actions.
 The 'Automated Meter Reading
     using AI' solution of the 'AI Fabric' project successfully detects and
     recognizes the value of meter reading and model or serial number from
     images of various meters, such as electric or water. This eliminates the
     need for manual data entry and reduces human errors, leading to improved
     efficiency and accuracy in processing and verification. The solution utilizes an Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) model to detect and extract the value of the meter reading
and the meter model or serial number from the uploaded images. The project employs advanced image processing techniques to enhance
     the quality of the images, improving the accuracy of the OCR model.

",Darwin," Indrajit Kar (i.kar@zensar.com), Zonunfeli Ralte (zonunfeli.ralte@zensar.com)",Zensar Technologies,Yes,,Yes,"
 Error
     reconstruction faces challenges in handling non-stationary signals
     and noisy environments, as even minor fluctuations can affect model
     performance. Attention-based LSTMs must be carefully tuned to avoid
     overfitting.
 In anomaly
     detection, the imbalance between normal and anomalous data is a
     significant challenge, requiring tailored sampling techniques. The
     Isolation Forest may also struggle with complex anomalies that exhibit
     gradual deviations rather than abrupt changes.
 For sensor
     grouping, managing high-dimensional and asynchronous data streams
     poses difficulties, as sensors may have different sampling rates. DTW and
     Agglomerative Clustering demand significant computational resources,
     necessitating optimization techniques.
 The Generative
     AI-based Q&A bot faces challenges in understanding complex
     technical queries and ensuring contextual accuracy. It must
     continuously learn from new data and user feedback to maintain relevance
     and reliability in providing recommendations. 
 Image variability: One of the key challenges faced in the AI Fabric
     project, particularly the Automated Meter Reading using AI solution, is
     dealing with the variability in meter images, such as different lighting
     conditions, angles, and image quality. The solution incorporates robust
     image processing techniques to handle these variations.
 OCR accuracy: Achieving high accuracy in OCR detection poses a
     challenge due to factors like noise, font variations, and image
     distortions. The project addresses this challenge through continuous
     training and improvement of the OCR model.

This project is under TBCB model and significant progress has been done in construction by KEC.

For this project all required authority approval and clearances are in scope of PGCIL. This line is passing nearby airport and falling under aviation zone at Magarwada end. After significant progress of the project, aviation authority has given critical observations regarding height of multi circuit towers as all spotted structures in aviation zone are beyond the limit of height restriction.

This was the major project risk observed after significant progress project, which was not considered by PGCIL during bidding stage. At several locations foundations already casted for multi circuit towers in aviation zone and tower material also manufactured and supplied at site. To eliminate the project risk, PGCIL requested KEC to propose suitable solution considering all technical restrictions as per locations specific permitted height without compromise electrical clearances and structural safety.

After several internal trials and brainstorming, KEC design team come out with excellent solution, to use Danube towers for locations falling in aviation area. PGCIL has reviewed and accepted the proposal after several round of discussion. After getting clearance on conceptual proposal from PGCIL, KEC design team has submitted designs of Danube towers QAD, QCD, QDD45 & QDD60. 

All Danube tower design has been done considering suitability with already casted foundations and considering maximum possible material utilization of supplied tower. PGCIL has revied design documents and approved all tower designs. Structural drawing preparation and shop sketches preparation are under progress for all Danube towers and will be completed shortly.

Observations for the way forward 


 Our tyres bead ring dia
     and taper angle are different than RO testing rims. Also bead dia of SKUs
     are different in same inch itself. This creating seating issue in RO
     testing. Need to standardise the same at least from the next sign off
     onwards & to work upon the already released sizes. Currently also we
     are releasing new sizes with 1mm RO yield >70% only…….
 Based on the competitor
     tyre analysis , observed that our material under bead and SW are in
     negative side wrt competitions. Ours Mean 1.1 and Std Dev 0.3 whereas
     competitors RO is <1mm (ppt attached). We can’t modify the moulds
     according to this without doing tyre reengineering to meet the required
     profile. Tyre weight also 100 gm lower side………..
 We have taken trial on
     FY24 with 4 modified test rims . 2 got success and another 2 got failed.
     Based on this input, going for 6 more modified test rims from low cost/
     local vendor as POC (ppt attached) with TCD 31.12.2024

This project embodies our dedication to creating products that not only perform at the highest levels but also contribute to a sustainable and eco-friendly future.Key Highlights:85% Sustainability in TBR Tyre Composition:
This tyre incorporates advanced materials and production processes that reduce its environmental impact. With 85% of the tyre composition made from sustainable sources, including innovative green compounds and recycled materials, we are setting a new benchmark in the industry.Compound Standardization Approach:
One of the core elements driving the increase in sustainability is our Compound Standardization Approach. By standardizing the compounds used across multiple tyre ranges, we achieve greater efficiency in sourcing, production, and performance, while minimizing waste and reducing the need for new raw materials. This approach not only boosts sustainability but also enhances the consistency and quality of the product.Performance and Durability:
The tyre has been engineered to meet the rigorous demands of the commercial vehicle sector, offering exceptional durability, enhanced fuel efficiency, and reduced rolling resistance. These improvements contribute to both the longevity of the tyre and a decrease in carbon emissions over the tyre's lifespan, further aligning with our carbon footprint reduction goals.Alignment with CEAT’s 2030 Vision:
This project is a step forward in our journey to meet CEAT's vision of reducing our carbon footprint by 50% by 2030. Through innovations like the 85% sustainable TBR tyre, we are not only advancing the technology behind our products but also actively contributing to a cleaner, greener future for the automotive industry.With this project, CEAT aims to set a global standard for sustainability in the TBR segment, paving the way for a more sustainable future in transportation.

ground surface around KEC Site office setup at Alwajh
store area, dust spread across the store and office premises most of the time.
In TM-411, we used to rely on portable water tankers for dust separation around
entrance gate-01, office and parking area. However, we are facing challenges in
getting water tankers on time due to the high demand for water and limited
supply in the Al Wajh
area. Upon noticing that the AC condenser water was being directly discharged
to the ground. I started finding the solution for best utilization of AC water
then I found that an average split AC produces approx. 1.5-2 liter
of water per hour. Moreover in high temperate, it is more. By adding total 18
AC units of Client & KEC office and average operation of all ACs will
produce 450 litters water per day. Additionally, I read that AC condenser water
has a low Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) level and requires less water per square
meter compared to utility water for dust separation.

I proposed this ESG initiative
idea for the implementation of an AC water harvesting system in front
of the project manager to reduce dependency on portable water tankers and to
align it with KEC Environmental commitment of 3R (Reduce, Reuse & Recycle)
and water-positivity ESG goal.

As a result of the AC water
harvesting system, we are harvesting 350-400 liter
of water daily by connecting SEC & KEC office AC units, which are utilizing
with the help of pressure pump & sprinkling nozzle for dust separation in
the office, parking, and Entrance Gate area. This initiative allows us to save
approximately 1000 liter
of water daily, leading to significant utility water savings, self reliable on
our resources with cost effective solutions.Key benefits of Harvesting AC condenser
water“The most effective way to prevent water
waste and save daily 1000 Ltr of fresh water”.ØDust exposure at the site office &
store area effectively controlledØThe daily approx. 1000 ltr
water sprinkled by a tanker, which cost us 100 SAR per day (Annual Cost INR 686,400.00). By utilizing an air-conditioning
water harvesting system for dust suppression, the cost has been reduced
to zero within a month.ØWater collected approximately 350-400 liters of
water per day. This water is now sufficient for the dust separation around the
Entrance gate, office, parking area & access roads inside store.ØTotal Cost of AC water harvesting system
installation is 1250
SAR. If compare with the water tanker cost
which we earlier used for the same purpose, We achieved our Return on Investment (ROI) in just
12 days.ØAs the supply water has high TDS, more
water is required for mitigation in per m2, as compared to air condition water
harvested as it has very low TDS.ØThis management of water eliminated the
monthly consumption of 2600
L  ( 312 kl/ annum) of
freshwater used for sprinkling. Also, with having more efficiency of
controlling fugitive dust in less amount of water.

These inefficiencies lead to higher operational costs, delayed decision-making, and inconsistent risk assessments, ultimately affecting customer satisfaction and profitability.Detailed
Solution: AI-Assisted Underwriting

The AI-assisted underwriting system in banking uses machine
learning to analyze financial data, credit scores, and customer profiles,
providing real-time risk assessments and recommendations. This automation
reduces processing time, minimizes errors, and enhances decision-making
accuracy. By continuously learning from new data, the system stays up-to-date
and integrates seamlessly with existing workflows, improving overall efficiency
and customer satisfaction. Below is the solution.

1. Data Collection and Integration The
AI-assisted underwriting system begins with collecting data from various
sources such as historical claims, financial records, customer profiles,
medical records, and external data like social media and IoT devices. This data
is then integrated into a centralized data lake, ensuring it is clean,
consistent, and ready for analysis.

2. Data Processing and Feature Engineering Once
the data is collected, it undergoes preprocessing to remove noise and
irrelevant information. Feature engineering is then performed to extract
meaningful features that can be used by machine learning models. This includes
transforming raw data into structured formats, normalizing values, and creating
new features that capture important patterns and relationships.

3. Model Development The core of the
AI-assisted underwriting system is the development of machine learning models.
These models are trained using historical data to predict risk and make
underwriting decisions. Common techniques include:

·       Supervised
Learning: Models are trained on labeled data where the outcome is
known, such as past claims data.

·       Unsupervised
Learning: Models identify patterns and relationships in data
without predefined labels, useful for anomaly detection.

·       Natural
Language Processing (NLP): Techniques like text classification
and sentiment analysis are used to analyze unstructured data from customer
interactions and documents.

4. Model Training and Validation The
models are trained using a portion of the data and validated on a separate set
to ensure they generalize well to new, unseen data. Techniques like
cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning are employed to optimize model
performance.

5. Real-Time Risk Assessment Once
trained, the models are deployed to perform real-time risk assessments. When a
new application is received, the system analyzes the data, applies the trained
models, and provides a risk score along with recommendations for underwriting
decisions. This process is automated, reducing the time and effort required by
human underwriters.

6. Continuous Learning and Improvement The
AI system continuously learns from new data and feedback. As more applications
are processed, the models are retrained periodically to incorporate the latest
information and improve accuracy. This ensures the system remains up-to-date
and effective in changing market conditions.

7. Integration with Underwriting Workflow The
AI-assisted system is integrated into the existing underwriting workflow,
providing underwriters with tools to review and validate AI-generated
recommendations. This human-in-the-loop approach ensures that underwriters can
leverage AI insights while retaining control over final decisions.

increasingly prominent in the banking sector, its applications in loan
approvals, credit scoring, and fraud detection are transforming the industry.
However, this growing reliance on AI also brings the significant challenge of
AI biases, which can lead to unfair and biased outcomes. Addressing these
biases is crucial but can be difficult for banks to tackle.

An AI
Bias Detection Tool aims to identify, analyze, and mitigate biases in
banking AI systems. By improving fairness and transparency, this tool enhances
customer trust, ensures regulatory compliance, and minimizes reputational
risks.Problem
Statement


 Unintentional Discrimination: AI systems trained on historical data may inherit biases (e.g.,
     against certain demographics), leading to unfair decisions.
 Lack of Transparency: Many AI algorithms
     operate as ""black boxes,"" making it difficult to understand
     decision-making processes.
 Regulatory Pressure: Increasing
     regulations (e.g., GDPR, Fair Lending laws) require banks to demonstrate
     fairness in AI-driven decisions.
 Customer Trust Erosion: Perceived or real
     bias in banking algorithms can damage customer relationships and brand
     reputation.
 Difficulty in Bias Detection: Identifying subtle biases across large datasets and complex
     models is time-consuming and technically challenging.
Solution / Recommendation:

Our solution
proposes to develop an accelerator to detect AI biases for banking and
financial institutions.

An AI
Bias Detection Tool for banking algorithms would perform the following
tasks: Data Analysis, Algorithmic Audit, Explainability Module, Bias mitigation, Regulatory Compliance Checks.",Greenball, Ashutosh Sharma (ashutosh.sharma@zensar.com),Zensar Technologies,Yes,,Yes,"
 Defining
     Bias: Bias is
     subjective and context-dependent, making it difficult to establish
     universal fairness criteria.
 Complexity
     of Models: Advanced AI
     models, such as neural networks, are harder to audit and explain due to
     their complexity.
 Data
     Privacy Concerns: Ensuring
     customer data remains protected during bias detection and analysis is
     critical.
 Regulatory
     Alignment: Different
     jurisdictions have varying definitions of fairness and regulatory
     requirements, complicating global implementation.
 Continuous
     Monitoring: Bias can emerge
     over time as algorithms learn from new data, requiring ongoing detection
     and retraining.

 We streamlined technical documentation and design diagrams using AI, specifically leveraging AI Engineering Buddy for reverse engineering codebases. This involved creating prompts for various tasks, including generating XML flowchart diagrams from code, plain-text explanations for Node.js, React.js, TypeScript, and Java Spring Boot, as well as code dependencies in Draw.io-compatible XML formats. Additionally, we produced architecture diagrams and flowcharts from backend logic.The project encompassed 1.98 GB of code, with input formats such as .jsx, .tsx, .ts, .js, .xml, .java, and .drawio. We processed a total of 121,594 files across 26,200 folders, ultimately generating 760 pages of documentation and 53 diagrams. The tools used for this project included AI Engineering Buddy and Data Buddy, with a human-in-the-loop approach for validation, contextual refinement, and iterative improvement.The effort involved in this project was substantial, with over 50 hours dedicated to prompt engineering, more than 100 hours for validation, and 60+ hours for refinement. In total, we analyzed 1,782,185 lines of code.

This is particularly challenging in live conversations, events, or international meetings, where understanding and accurately translating spoken content is crucial. Existing translation tools often lack the ability to provide real-time processing, accurate translations, and adaptability for dynamic, continuous conversations. There is a need for a tool that can seamlessly transcribe and translate live audio with minimal delay.Proposed SolutionWe propose an application built using Python and Streamlit that can record audio in real-time, transcribe it, and translate it into another language with a short delay. The workflow is as follows:Audio Recording and Segmentation: The application will continuously record audio, segmenting it into manageable 3 to 5-second intervals to allow for efficient processing.Transcription: Each audio segment is transcribed into text using the Whisper speech-to-text model, ensuring high accuracy in transcription.Translation: The transcribed text is then translated into English or any other target language using GPT-4, which provides advanced language translation capabilities.Parallel Processing: These processes—recording, transcription, and translation—will run in parallel, resulting in a slight delay of 3 to 5 seconds for real-time translation, while still offering a dynamic and fluid user experience.Additionally, the application will allow users to save the entire conversation as a Word document or PDF, offering an alternative for those who prefer written records over continuous audio.This solution presents a practical and scalable approach to overcoming language barriers during live interactions, making multilingual communication more accessible and efficient.Innovation in Translation Technology:By leveraging AI models like Whisper and GPT-4, this application demonstrates the potential for advancements in real-time translation technologies. It will inspire further innovation in breaking down language barriers and creating new solutions for multilingual communication.By addressing the technical challenges associated with real-time transcription and translation, this application can make significant strides in improving multilingual communication, fostering collaboration, and making global interactions more inclusive.",Greenball, Rahul Madhusudan Joshi (rahul.joshi1@zensar.com),Zensar Technologies,No, Raviranjan Singh (raviranjan.singh@zensar.com),Yes,"Real-time Processing:Achieving low latency in the transcription and translation processes is a significant challenge, particularly when using advanced models like Whisper and GPT-4. Optimizing response time while maintaining accuracy will be critical to ensuring a seamless experience for the user.Audio Quality:Background noise, unclear speech, and overlapping voices can degrade transcription accuracy. To address this, robust preprocessing methods (such as noise reduction) will be required to enhance the quality of recorded audio before transcription.Language Nuances:Translating spoken language into another language while maintaining context, tone, and cultural nuances is difficult, especially when dealing with idiomatic expressions or specialized terminology. Achieving accurate and context-sensitive translations will be challenging but necessary.Scalability:Handling multiple languages, diverse accents, and large-scale audio data without compromising on translation quality could be resource-intensive, especially for real-time applications. Efficient resource management and model optimization will be required to scale the system effectively.Integration and UI Design:Designing a user-friendly interface that is intuitive and can display real-time translations while simultaneously managing the backend processes of audio recording, transcription, and translation will require careful planning and development. The interface must also offer easy access to downloadable transcripts in Word or PDF formats. ",,"Qualitative Impact:{Qualitative Impact,External},{Remarks,<span><p><strong>Enhanced Communication</strong>:&#160;<span>Seamless communication between individuals who speak different languages, promoting better understanding and collaboration in real-time.

The arrangement consists of below and successfully implemented in 400kV D/C Bogura-Kaliakoir T/L (Bangladesh) by the stringing S/C.Design and Components:Steel Structure: A robust frame made of steel to ensure durability and strength.Wheels: Fitted at the base to allow easy movement, similar to a mini trailer.Chain Pulley Arrangement: Installed at the top to facilitate the lifting and unloading of drums. Spindle arrangement across the frame for carrying the drum safely FunctionalityMobility: The wheels enable the structure to be easily moved to different locations without the need for a crane or hydra.Lifting Mechanism: The chain pulley system allows for the safe and efficient lifting of heavy drums. This can be manually operated depending on the load and frequency of use.Unloading: Once the drum is lifted, it can be transported to the desired location and unloaded without additional heavy machinery.Kaizen BenefitsEfficiency: Reduces the time and effort required to move and unload drums, leading to increased productivity.Cost-Effective: Eliminates the need for expensive cranes or hydras, saving on equipment and operational costs.Safety: Minimizes the risk of accidents associated with manual handling or the use of large machinery.Flexibility: Can be used in various locations and for different types of loads, making it a versatile solution.",Darwin,,KEC,No, Satyendu Adhikari (adhikaris@kecrpg.com),No,"In case of breakdown of hydra/crane of store, loading drum was a big challenge as due to heavy weight of drums it's merely impossible to load the drums in truck manually.

governance and realization of all value for which a group or entity is
responsible. It may apply both to tangible assets (physical
objects such as complex process or manufacturing plants, infrastructure,
buildings or equipment) and to intangible assets (such as intellectual property, goodwill or financial
assets). Asset management is a systematic process of developing,
operating, maintaining, upgrading, and disposing of assets in the most
cost-effective manner (including all costs, risks, and performance attributes).

At our RaychemRPG, being manufacturing company, machineries
and equipment are main and important assets for us. There will be thousands of machines
and equipment in different plants and locations used. 

At present these assets are managed manually at RRL. Though
we have all system and data for all assets, still one good improvement in asset
management can be done by adding one digital feature in this activity.

Sometimes we are facing challenges in finding assets because
those machines and equipment are handled by multiple persons or may be very old
and not in use condition. In such cases, we need to search for those assets’
location which is nonvalue activity.

Now idea is to simplify this process – to create a
digital asset tag. Yes, this asset tag will have microchip, QR code etc. on its
tag itself. This tag will be permanently fixed with the asset.

This digital asset tag having GPS based microchip in it and will
be connected with local server/system or different satellite platform which will
indicate its location. So, anytime if we need to find out any asset we can
search first in portal/system for its live/current location and can reach to it
easily. QR code on asset tag can give us all information we need for that
asset. In whole we can manage and track our assets through RFID.

Radio Frequency Identification is a technology that allows for the
identification and tracking of assets using radio waves. RFID tags are small,
electronic devices that consist of a microchip and an antenna. These tags can
be attached to
assets such as equipment, tools, inventory,
or vehicles, allowing them to be easily scanned and tracked.

These challenges must be addressed to ensure the project’s success and efficiency. Below are some of the key challenges in the development of such a project:1. Precision and Accuracy in MeasurementChallenge: Achieving high precision in measuring mass in both air and water is crucial for accurate specific gravity calculations. Any slight errors in weight measurement, sample handling, or submersion depth could lead to incorrect results.Solution: This can be mitigated by integrating highly sensitive sensors, such as advanced load cells and force sensors, and calibrating them regularly. Fine-tuning the robotic arm’s movements and ensuring its stability during the test process is also essential.2. Complexity in Sample HandlingChallenge: Different materials may have varying sizes, shapes, and weights, which complicates the robot’s ability to handle them efficiently. Some samples may be fragile or difficult to submerge consistently, affecting the test’s accuracy.Solution: Developing a versatile gripper or handling mechanism that can adapt to various sample types is essential. Additionally, the robotic arm must be able to handle delicate samples without causing damage. Programming and feedback mechanisms will need to ensure proper sample placement and handling.3. Environmental Control for Consistent TestingChallenge: The testing environment, particularly the temperature and humidity, can significantly affect the accuracy of the specific gravity measurements. Variations in water temperature, for example, can alter the density of water and, consequently, affect the test results.Solution: Incorporating temperature sensors and environmental controls within the system to regulate water temperature and ensure consistency in test conditions. The system should also allow for easy calibration to account for any environmental variations.4. System Integration and CoordinationChallenge: The robotic arm, sensors, and data processing systems must work seamlessly together. Integration issues may arise between hardware and software components, or between the robot’s motion control and sensor data acquisition systems.Solution: Careful design of the system architecture with a clear understanding of how each component communicates. This requires close collaboration between robotics engineers, software developers, and hardware designers. Rigorous testing and validation of each subsystem are crucial before full integration.5. Software and Algorithm DevelopmentChallenge: Developing reliable algorithms for controlling the robot’s actions (e.g., handling samples, submerging them accurately), as well as for calculating and analyzing the specific gravity based on sensor data, can be complex.Solution: Developing robust software that can handle real-time data processing, automation, and user interface. Machine learning or advanced algorithms might be used to optimize the testing process and ensure accuracy. The software should be flexible enough to adapt to different sample types and environments.6. Cost and Resource ConstraintsChallenge: High-quality sensors, robotic arms, and precision components required for such a system can be expensive, potentially driving up the overall cost of development and production.Solution: Careful selection of cost-effective yet reliable components is necessary. Exploring partnerships with manufacturers or suppliers who can offer discounted bulk pricing or custom solutions can also help manage costs. Additionally, focusing on scalable designs can ensure long-term cost efficiency as the system is deployed at larger scales.7. Maintenance and CalibrationChallenge: Automated systems require ongoing maintenance and calibration to ensure consistent performance over time. Any slight drift in sensors or mechanical parts can lead to inaccurate results.Solution: Implementing automated self-calibration features and diagnostic tools within the robot can help monitor system health and detect deviations in real time. The system can be designed to notify users of any need for recalibration or maintenance.8.

The main principle of extrusion cooling line
is to maintain the weight (mass) of the tread for which exact synchronization between
various conveyors is required. If the synchronization is not maintained, then
there will be stretching or loop formation between the conveyors. 

To overcome the speed error dancer is required
which gives the feedback of conveyor surface speed to the control system. The
control system then synchronizes the speed between two conveyors. If there is a
synchronization error beyond controlling, then huge scrap is generated. Now, we
have provided one alarm system with a dedicated display to the operator so that
in case speed error goes above 1% then it will give alarm so that operator can
take necessary action. If the error goes more than 1.5% then it will directly
stop the extrusion process.

all about to eliminate the steam lock in boiler feed water line which may lead
to boiler low water level & steam pressure drop at user end.

 

Our steam
generation system consists of 4 boilers. 
Each boiler has 2 Nos. of feed water pumps where one is in operation
& other one is standby.

 

There is a
Non-Return Valve (NRV) installed after every feed water pump. If this NRV fails,
then steam from boiler passes to the feed water pump & then to the main
feed water line of the boiler leading to formation of a steam lock in the
entire system. Due to this steam lock, feed water supply to the boiler stops
& the boiler goes to low water level. At Low water level boils stops
working, so there will be no steam generation leading to pressure drop at user
end.

 

In our innovation we
installed a temperature sensor in the main feed water line to the boiler. If
steam comes in the line, then the temperature of feed water line increases as
the temperature of feed water is less than steam.

 

If the feed water
line temperature goes beyond 100 Deg C, then an alarm will come & the media
from feed water line is released through a control valve to the condensate
tank. This release of media results in automatic removal of steam lock from the
line.

Then the operator
can check NRV of which pump has bypassed & isolate that pump & start
the standby pump.",Darwin, Uttam Wagh (uttam.wagh@ceat.com),CEAT,No, Stephan Valerian (stephen.fernandes@ceat.com),No,"1)     Installation of

all about a soot blower to remove ash (soot) from the interior walls of the
boiler heating surfaces thus preventing a deposit build up which would
adversely affect the heat transfer efficiency of the boiler heating surface.

Our earlier system
was fixed manual rotary type in which there was a steam valve (Fig. 1) which
supplies steam to a blowing tube having multiple nozzles throughout its length which
remains in the boiler at all times & that blowing tube is manually rotated
through a rotary geared mechanism.As the blowing tube
remains in the boiler at all the times there was high chance that the tube gets
bend due to high temperature inside the furnace.

 

There is a
disadvantage to this in that during soot blowing, a pressure reduction
occurs from drive end to non-drive end of the blowing tube due to multiple
nozzles throughout its length.There is one more
disadvantage that if the there is some passing from soot blowing steam valve, then
since the blowing tube is inside the boiler there is condensate formation which
comes in contact with the ash leading to high scale formation inside the
boiler.

 

There is one more
disadvantage that a temperature reduction occurs in the boiler furnace as
the steam used for soot blowing cools the tubes due to blowing of steam through
multiple nozzles of blowing tube.

 

We innovated a soot
blower which is retractable type with motorised operation & only at the
time of soot blowing the blowing tube goes inside the boiler & rest of the
time the tube remains outside the boiler so there is no chance of tube getting
bend.Also, the blowing
tube has two nozzles at its non-drive end (Fig. 4) so there is no pressure
reduction. So, there is uniform cleaning.Since, the blowing
tube doesn’t remain inside the boiler at all the times so there is no chance of
condensate going inside the boiler furnace.

 

Since, the blowing
tube has only two nozzles there is no temperature reduction inside the boiler
furnace. ",Darwin, Uttam Wagh (uttam.wagh@ceat.com),CEAT,No, Stephan Valerian (stephen.fernandes@ceat.com),No,"1)     Space constraint
for installing the retractable soot blower in place of manual soot blower – made
alternate arrangement & installed the retractable soot blower on the
opposite side of the boiler furnace.

2)     Regular leakage
from rotary gland of the blowing tube- Change the MOC of gland from asbestos to
Teflon.

3)     Overtravel of
blowing tube in running condition & then hitting to the end plate of boiler
furnace- provided additional safety plate after the backward limit switch to
avoid overtravel. ",,"Qualitative Impact:{Qualitative Impact,Internal}","Realised so far:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}","Projected Annually:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}",Yes,41,

Blockchain technology, combined with the concept of self-sovereign identity (SSI), offers a revolutionary approach to digital identity management. This new paradigm empowers individuals to have full control over their personal data, enhancing privacy and security while simplifying identity verification processes.Understanding Self-Sovereign IdentitySelf-sovereign identity is a decentralized identity model where individuals own and control their digital identities without relying on a central authority. Unlike traditional identity systems, where personal data is stored and managed by third parties, SSI allows users to store their identity data on their own devices and share it selectively with trusted entities. This approach ensures that individuals have complete autonomy over their personal information, reducing the risk of data breaches and identity theft.The Role of Blockchain in SSIBlockchain technology underpins the SSI model by providing a secure and immutable ledger for identity transactions. Each identity credential issued, verified, or shared is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and trust. Blockchain's decentralized nature eliminates the need for a central authority, making it ideal for managing self-sovereign identities. The use of cryptographic techniques ensures that identity data is secure and tamper-proof, further enhancing the reliability of the system.Key Benefits of Blockchain-Based SSIEnhanced Privacy and Security: With SSI, individuals can control who has access to their personal data and for what purpose. Blockchain's encryption and decentralized storage ensure that identity data is protected from unauthorized access and cyber threats.User Empowerment: SSI empowers users by giving them full control over their digital identities. They can choose which credentials to share and with whom, ensuring that their personal information is only used as intended.Reduced Fraud and Identity Theft: Blockchain's immutable ledger makes it extremely difficult for malicious actors to alter or forge identity credentials.

comprehensive survey was distributed to all of our client's suppliers. 

The goal was to capture detailed information about their

times. 

Utilizing this data, we developed a dynamic dashboard using
a Business Intelligence (BI) Visualization tool. This dashboard allows users to
input the epicenter of a natural calamity, specified by latitude and longitude,
along with a desired radius in kilometers or miles. 

The tool then identifies impacted suppliers and provides
crucial information about alternative sub-tier suppliers who can supply the
affected parts or products, ensuring minimal disruption.

This solution not only strengthens the client's supply chain
resilience but also sets a benchmark for proactive risk management and
strategic planning in the face of natural disasters.

In a competitive vendor landscape, many new openings/positions
are lost to our competitors because of not having readily deployable pool of skilled
resources, especially at client site.Solution:We can build a pool of trained resources, especially at client
site – at a very low initial cost. How?·     
We
have a substantial number of associates deployed at client sites, across
various geographies, but I am considering USA geography as an example for the below
use case.·     
The
spouses of such associates are, many a times, academically qualified to be considered
as skilled IT resources.·     
They
may need to be trained before being deployed on billable positions.·     
But
they are available – and if given an opportunity, will be willing to work at a
significantly low cost compared to regular H1/L1 FTE’s.  Constraints? – sure, but can they be used for our benefit. Constraint:·     
The
known constraint is – whether these spouses are legally eligible to work –
unfortunately, they are not on day1.·     
But
for all the H1/L1 associates who (and whenever) can get an EAD or similar work
eligible visas for their spouses, can be considered for this program.·     
And
we already have a considerable number of FTE’s who have EADs for their spouses.·     
We
can even lower the entry barrier of 4+ yrs of onsite stay, so that the H1/L1 associates
get their I140’s and spouse EADs sooner – for eligible spouses. Our benefit·     
The
time taken to for these spouses to be eligible for work in the US – can be used
to train them (without any salary cost to Zensar during this period).·     
So
Zensar will be investing (mostly only in training costs) in building a workforce,
which can be deployed in the near future, at a very low initial salary cost to
Zensar.  Costs?·     
Not
much.·     
Just
open up the existing training infrastructure (ZenLearn, Skillsoft, and other
online training portals) for these qualified spouses.·     
Build
and assign a training programs – with milestone evaluations – on commonly
required technologies.",Greenball,,Zensar Technologies,Yes,,No,"Challenges Faced: Losing new positions or not being able to propose new positions due to lack of resource availability.The proposed Model (customizable)

 

Use cases for this new workforce:

1.   Resource deployments for new
onsite positions:

o    This
newly trained workforce can be deployed at a low initial billing rate to the clients,
on a trial period viz. for 6 months or a year, and later upon building confidence,
can be converted to regular billing rates.o    This
low onsite billing rate can be used as a tool to undercut our competitive
vendors – a low onsite billing rate is unheard off and can be a game changing strategy,
if used effectively.



 

2.  
While
resourcing for multiple onsite position proposals (fixed price contracts), we build
a mix of senior and these low cost onsite resources, and can save costs or
undercut our competitors in pricing.

 

3.  
This
new workforce can be used for building POC’s for aiding our Proposals (for net
new or existing clients), with help and guidance from senior FTE’s.

 

4.  
Depending
on client situation, these resources could be offered as EBR’s initially and
later converted into billable headcount.

 

5.  
During
onsite resource churn/attrition, these resources can be used as a stop-gap
solution avoiding very heavy cost last minute external hire.

 

6.  
This
workforce can also be trained and deployed in the non-billable support functions
viz. HR, tech support etc.

 

 

Cost implications of this workforce:

·     
The
Major benefit here, is not having any minimum salary considerations from USCIS for
EAD resources, unlike the strict regulations and scrutiny of the H1/L1 resources.

·     
So,
this workforce can be employed (at literally half the cost or lower) since their billing
rates will be low.

·     
We
can even consider temporary employment like a ‘low stipend payout model’ during
initial phases until the resource has proven themselves and achieved a client billable
status.Benefits:·

Function: Configuration management

 

Abstract: Describe the project in brief (up to 500 words)

Problem Statement:

Organization runs software for automating the business process
either use OOB or Inhouse develop product, they all maintain different software
environments for ensuring the quality, reliability, and user satisfaction of
software. Different environments, such as development, testing, staging, and
production play a vital role in the software development lifecycle.

Maintaining an environment is a challenge, due to frequent
changes in source code, configuration, parameter and reference data, discrepancies
to any of this results in business functions behaves differently in different
environments. 

Source code discrepancy challenges is addressed using
software configuration repository tool, however discrepancy in configuration, parameter
and reference data still remains. The main cause of this is due to omissions
due to human error and the accuracy of keeping a reference data asset in the
desired state.

When issue/defect occurs in the production environment,
developers usually try to simulate it in testing environments, unable to
simulate in first instance is due to omissions/accuracy of keeping a reference
data asset in the desired state.

Upon investigation it is realized it is due to discrepancies
in configuration, parameter, and reference data files.

 

Solution/Recommendations:

Identify the configuration and reference table as
configuration item in the configuration management system, add it to a repository,
baseline it as master copy. 

Use centralized repository tool like GitHub/Puppet/Terraform
to store, manage, share, and revise the baseline data.

This would enable an organization to have baselined
configuration/reference data standardized across all the environments.

Alternatively, AI tool can be integrated into an existing
process which would compare baselined table with tables in different environments,
generate a report, notify to the customer about discrepancies, and resolve it
subsequently.

 

 

Target business:

1.      
Across industry like Banking/Insurance/Any
business using OOB application, who receives frequent upgrade.

2.      
Software Product development/servicing
organization.

 

Benefits:

1.      
Environment readiness

Effective maintenance of environment, this
would ensure software system working correctly, efficiently and continues to
meet the needs of the users.

 

2.      
Early detection and Resolution of defects

Defect replication/simulation will be
quick, allows developers for root cause analysis and fix bugs early in the
development process

 

3.      
Cost reduction to business

Save several man-days which otherwise would
have been spent to simulate/replicate the issue for the purpose of root cause
analysis. It is estimated developers spent half the time replicating the issue.

To create a
centralized DevOps account that consolidates infrastructure and code pipelines
for multiple projects, ensuring streamlined deployment processes, enhanced
security, and efficient management of development, UAT, and production
environments.

 

Current Setup:

In our
existing infrastructure, we maintain DevOps infrastructure and code pipelines
independently within the development or UAT accounts of each project. This
decentralized approach leads to several challenges, including:

- Difficulty
in managing multiple environments

-
Inconsistent deployment processes

- Increased
security risks due to fragmented setups

-
Inefficiencies in resource utilization

 

Problem Statement:

Currently,
our DevOps practices are decentralized, with each project maintaining its own
infrastructure and code pipelines within separate development or UAT accounts.
This fragmentation leads to inconsistencies, management challenges, and
security vulnerabilities. Additionally, it creates inefficiencies in resource
utilization and complicates the deployment process.

 

Innovation Plan:

To address these challenges, we propose the development of a
Centralized DevOps Hub. This hub will house all project-specific
infrastructure and code pipelines within a single AWS account, ensuring a
unified approach to deployment and management. This will involve:

- Centralizing code repositories for all projects

- Standardizing deployment pipelines

- Implementing approval processes for deployments to
different environments (DEV, UAT, PROD)

will effectively stop persons from falling.

The vertical pipes were fabricated with
base plate welded and both sides of the pipes made with 16 mm diameter hole for
fixing the 16 mm diameter nut bolt.

This arrangement enables the vertical

focuses on digitizing the CEO Dashboard using Microsoft Power BI to create an
interactive, real-time, and visually rich dashboard, providing a consolidated
view of key performance indicators (KPIs) and business metrics essential for
executive decision-making. 



This
Power BI-based CEO Dashboard is designed to consolidate data from Oracle Fusion
and transform it into an intuitive, interactive visual format, empowering
leadership to monitor critical business metrics in real time. The dashboard
focuses on presenting high-level insights with the ability to drill down into
granular data when required. This innovative approach leverages data.",Equinox, Rajesh Ganesh (rajesh_ganesh@raychemrpg.com),Raychem RPG,Yes,,Yes,"a) Resources: In-house Skilled resources availability for implementation and Design of various reportsb) Data

Statement

With the advent
of enormous digitalization and most organizations working towards upgrading to
the cloud, there has been a sharp marked increase in security breaches,
ransomware attacks, malware, social engineering, distributed denial of service
attacks and other exploitation of vulnerabilities, that compromise sensitive
information and disrupt operations. These threats highlight the importance of
compliance to the various security standards laid down by various organizations
in their daily operations. 

To control, regularize
and avoid data breach, regulators have come up compliance initiatives to manage
security threats. Various compliance standards/regulations/audit frameworks
include:

·        
GDPR

·        
PCI DSS

·        
HIPAA

·        
ISO 27001

·        
ISO 27701

·        
AICPA- SOC

·        
CCPA

·        
CSA

It can be
observed that compliance has been revised with multiple versions to ensure
security measures are up-to-date. Understanding the implications of each
version can be overwhelming. These standards usually take the form of various
compliance audits which is primarily done manually. Such manual efforts are
time consuming, enormous efforts are expended in data collection, such efforts
are labour-intensive and challenges faced in meeting compliance-enforced
timelines. 

Determining the
extent to which an organization meets compliance metrics can be arduous and is
a formidable task. 

 

Solution / Recommendation

Our solution envisages
the introduction of a new framework to evaluate the present organizational
standards against compliance benchmarks and to notify the current level of
compliance based on matrices prescribed by underlying regulatory requirements or
certificatory recommendations. 

Our solution proposes
to be fungible for multiple compliance and audit programs by effortlessly
integrating with existing systems. 

We elaborate the
workings of this framework with our pilot use case  -  PCI
DSS certification and rate organizations on their levels of compliance based on
established matrices. 

Our solution intends
to uncomplicate PCI DSS compliance assessment, for those to whom it is
applicable by designing a framework to help organizations and businesses comply
with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) requirements by
automating activities to ensure continuous adherence to PCI DSS standards.

 

Key Advantages to
businesses by adopting this framework:

Permanent, Contractual & Team lease workmen. Along with following daily
work processes & aiming for Employee satisfaction the Management
performance areas would lie on ensuring Employee payment being done on time
which is inclusive of allowances & OT. However, recently there have been
delay in Contractual payments due to manual interventions further leading to
data integrity concerns.  

The bottom line is there was minimal visibility of
Contractual workmen in plant with cases such as - Some areas having excess
manpower, but other department would have shortage of skilled workmen which
would lead to higher employee Cost (LTS). Daily Production, running in 3 shifts
which requires assignment of Employees to a Business process – Department,
Production machines to record their period of work done, these outputs were
maintained on Notebook giving room for manipulation & erasable actions.
There would be a significant delay in salary process taking up to 7-8 days’
timeline. Other manual intervention of OT memos & punch regularizations
compiling & caused further delay.

Major analysis led to finding differences in Vendor
Generated Bills & CEAT verified records of attendance every
month based on the records compiled in Excel received from Notebooks. 

It was decided to implement a Digital solution than
strengthen the manual process for addressing Audit observations and gaining
manpower visibility.  Since there was no
central repository of Employee details, efforts began with covering their
positions, KYC details, joining dates a total 15 masters prepared for count of
2300+ employees. With 15+ information criteria’s proper mapping to the
Employees with their Employee ID, Department, Designation, Skill, allowance eligibility
& Vendor details. A wireframe was designed to create a user-friendly
solution that would let shopfloor employees to easily make entries. Right from
Attendance captured via Face recognition to where attendance is missed from
capturing Multiple PDCA were done while implementing the solution &
brainstorming with Shopfloor associates, to understand & capture their

To keep programs up to date and safe it is required to continuously refactor the code.Problem:Once application is developed and went live in production, we rarely think about refactoring the code. Effort is only made to address the production issue and apply fixes to it to incorporate business continuity.As a result, code becomes old over the time, it stops allowing new features to integrate due to its own limitations, its enhancement becomes a bottleneck and it starts impacting the business slowly. A stage will come when there will be no room for further enhancements and then a decision will be made to rewrite the code using latest technologies and approach. This approach will take time, effort and it is costly too.Example is applications written in Mainframe.Solution:Instead of waiting for prolonged time for an issue to surface, effort should be made to continuously retrospect the code and try to find potential area of improvement.Rewrite or upgrade the code with new enhanced program and algorithms and repeat the cycle.

The concrete floor shall be cast in panel wise; the casting sequence shall be in a chequered board fashion; no two adjacent panels being cast on same day.B) lronite finish steps to be followed:1) After the concrete has stiffened to the point of supporting floating operations, open the surface by hand floating or power floating. Normally, a finisher’s footprint or 6.4mm to 9.5mm depth indicates that a slab is ready for power floating. Earlier floating of slab edges by hand is strongly recommended since edges will dry first.2) For best result and uniformity of thickness, IRONITE NO. 3 Shake 3.5 to 4.5 kgs per M² should be applied in two shakes using approximately two -thirds of the total amount for the first shake.4) Immediately after the slab surface has been opened by floating, apply the first shake in a uniform application by hand, spreader, or other suitable method.5) Allow the first shake to remain non-worked on the surface until it has absorbed moisture and achieved a dark uniform colour. Then float with hand or power float. Immediately apply second shake starting from the edges.6) After second shake has absorbed its moisture, float in the same manner as outlined above working the edges first, then cross floating for a level, uniform surface.7) First Steel Trowelling. Flat trowelling should be done, keeping the trowel flat and only after the surface has become dull.8) Final Steel Trowelling. When the surface, has set sufficiently so that no additional water or fines are brought to the surface, a second and final trowelling shall be given to the floor. During this operation the trowel should be slightly raised to give a hard and smooth finish. Continue trowelling process until the desired surface finish is achieved.9) Construction joint shall be placed After 7days curing done the Specified contraction joints with chanized groove cutting of size 4250x4250mm horizontal/vertical both sides size 3 to 4mm wide and 10-15 mm deep.

Although the Supply Chain Management (SCM) and Supplier Quality Assurance (SQA) teams enhanced in-house processes, a new issue emerged where white/ivory patches were observed inside the bosses. These patches, identified as residual powder from the powder coating process, would oxidize and lead to rust during meter assembly, causing rejections during incoming inspections.Root Cause Analysis:Initial Investigation:Supplier feedback indicated that the patches were caused by excess powder collecting during the coating process.Despite this explanation, the patches led to rust formation, rendering the bosses unusable.Large numbers of bosses were rejected in incoming inspections, necessitating segregation to maintain production continuity.Challenges:The single-source supply of bosses constrained the ability to switch suppliers.SCM was required to manually segregate defective bosses to prevent production delays, creating significant operational inefficiencies.The powder coating vendor was initially unaware of the defect origin.Recreation of the Defect:Through process audits at the powder coater's facility, the defect was successfully replicated, confirming its root cause.The powder coater proposed replacing mild steel (MS) rods with stainless steel (SS) rods to address the issue. However, this solution involved a cost escalation exceeding ?3,00,000.Solution Implementation:Process Optimization:A detailed analysis and trials were conducted to identify cost-effective alternatives.A revised process was established at the powder coater’s facility involving:Cleaning and plating each holding rod used during powder coating.Monitoring and validating the revised process parameters to ensure defect elimination.Outcome:The defect was completely eradicated without requiring an expensive switch to SS rods.From October onwards, all received lots of bosses were 100% defect-free, with no rejections reported due to the white/ivory patches issue.Key Impact:Cost Savings: Avoided a potential expense of ?3,00,000 by optimizing the existing process.Operational Efficiency: Eliminated manual segregation of defective bosses, ensuring smooth production flow.Supplier Collaboration: Strengthened partnerships through process improvement and mutual resolution of issues.",Darwin," Vijay Taiwade (vijay_taiwade@raychemrpg.com), Yogesh Naik (ynaik@raychemrpg.com)",Raychem RPG,Yes,,No,"Challenges faced :


Rust Issue in Bosses:

Initial rust formation on the end connections of gas meter bosses caused significant setbacks and rejections.



White/Ivory Patches Defect:

New defects (white/ivory patches) appeared inside bosses post-powder coating, leading to additional rust formation during assembly.



Single-Source Supplier Dependency:

Reliance on a single supplier limited flexibility and options for addressing quality issues without impacting production.



Continuous Lot Rejections:

Incoming inspection frequently rejected lots due to the defect, leading to disruptions in the supply chain.



Production Disruption:

SCM had to manually segregate defective bosses to maintain production continuity, adding to daily operational challenges.



Lack of Initial Supplier Awareness:

The powder coating vendor was unaware of the defect's occurrence, delaying resolution.



High Proposed Cost for a Solution:

The supplier’s initial solution of replacing MS rods with SS rods involved a cost escalation of over ?3,00,000, making it economically unviable.



Defect Recreation and Diagnosis:

Identifying and replicating the root cause at the powder coater's facility required extensive process audits and trials.



Operational Inefficiency:

The need to juggle defect resolution and production continuity placed a significant burden on SCM operations.



Vendor Process Challenges:

Convincing the powder coater to adopt and implement a new cleaning and plating process required effort and collaboration.

One of the main tools used by Nedbank for collection is Debt Manager (version DM7 & DM11) deployed in Azure VM (IaaS) within Nedbank domain. As part of modernization and cloud native initiative, planning to move to SaaS version of Debt Manager which is on AWS cloud, and it is outside Nedbank domain. As part of the business requirements, DM needs to collect additional information of customers from various other Nedbank services/applications at runtime. For that DM11 is calling respective application's APIs using either JWT or clientID and secret. These APIs are private APIs and not Public APIs. One of the biggest blockers to move to DM SaaS was to have the right API security pattern considering the Nedbank security guardrail. The constraint is Nedbank internal APIs' (Private API) security keys (like JWT or clientId/secret) cannot be sent outside Nedbank domain. Also the API must be called in the user context (user JWT).  There was no security pattern existed in Nedbank to support this scenario.  Without having JWT, DM SaaS cannot call the APIs, and we cannot move to DM SaaS.  Finding the security pattern for it was very critical.We have solved this by creating a new API security pattern which ensures that the JWT remains within Nedbank domain but still SaaS application can call the APIs.We solved by1. Integrating the DM SaaS UI with Nedbank Staff Portal UI (Nedbank internal web application) as an iFrame.2. When a user logon to Staff Portal, Staff Portal gets a JWT token.3. Passing the JWT from Staff Portal to DM iFrame.4. Using that JWT, DM UI (client-side code) calls the APIs.We built working POC first & presented to the Security Architects and Infosec team at Nedbank. The pattern was very well approved by them. The pattern will be now used for other projects as well where thirdparty tool outside Nedbank domain wants to call Nedbank Internal APIs. Current status: It is implemented and in production for DM11. ",NeoStar,,Zensar Technologies,Yes,,Yes,,,"Qualitative Impact:{Qualitative Impact,External}","Realised so far:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}","Projected Annually:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}",Yes,47,

However, many organizations struggle with integrating and analyzing customer feedback from various sources, leading to fragmented insights and missed opportunities for improvement.Problem: Quality team is facing several challenges in managing and analyzing customer sentiment:Data Fragmentation: Customer feedback is scattered across multiple sources, including CSAT files, CL files, RAYG files, and Escalations files, making it difficult to get a unified view of customer sentiment.Lack of Standardization: There was no standardized process for connecting and analyzing these diverse data sources, leading to inconsistencies and potential errors.Qualitative Data Complexity: Analyzing qualitative feedback to determine sentiment is inherently complex and subjective, requiring sophisticated tools and methodologies.Solution: To address these challenges, we developed a comprehensive customer sentiment analysis tool that integrates data from the four key sources. The primary key for connecting all documents is the Customer Name/Account Name, ensuring a consistent and unified approach. The tool supports XLS/CSV file formats, making it easy to upload and process data.Process:Data Integration: The tool seamlessly integrates data from CSAT, CL, RAYG, and Escalations files using the Customer Name/Account Name as the primary key.

IntroductionIn the fast-paced world of UX/UI design, the transition from design to development can sometimes feel like a game of telephone. The design vision is handed off, and inevitably, small discrepancies or errors can crop up as the code is written. As designers, we all want the final product to match our original vision—not just in look and feel, but also in functionality.To ensure the developed UI matches the designs exactly, We found a simple but effective process we like to call Desk Check. This process involves carefully reviewing the design screens in the development environment, cross-checking every visual element to ensure it aligns perfectly with the design specifications.The Desk Check process is not just about perfectionism; it’s about ensuring that design and development teams are on the same page, and preventing costly mistakes that can arise when details are missed.2. Why Desk Check MattersMaintaining Design IntegrityDesigners and developers often speak different languages. A designer might specify a button’s exact padding, color, or hover effect in a Figma file, but once the design hits the development environment, small deviations can occur—sometimes unnoticed. Desk Check ensures that the pixel-perfect vision you’ve crafted remains intact throughout development.When designs are implemented with attention to detail, it maintains the integrity of the user experience. A consistent, seamless design ensures that users don’t face friction or confusion, which is essential for delivering a polished final product.Better Collaboration Between TeamsOne of the key benefits of the Desk Check process is fostering collaboration between design and development teams. Instead of relying solely on handoff documentation or static design files, you’re engaging directly with the live implementation, offering real-time feedback, and guiding the developer to get it just right.This constant back-and-forth—while it may seem time-consuming—helps build stronger communication, ensuring that both sides understand what needs to be done to match the design vision. It also reduces the likelihood of misunderstandings or rework due to unclear specifications.Time and Cost EfficiencyCatching discrepancies early in the development phase can save time and money down the line. Small errors—like incorrect font sizes, improper spacing, or missed hover states—might not seem like much on their own, but they add up over time and can require multiple iterations to fix. These changes often result in additional dev hours, delays, and eventually higher costs.By thoroughly reviewing your designs during the Desk Check process, you are ensuring that any mistakes are caught early, meaning you can avoid back-and-forth corrections and keep the project on track, both time-wise and budget-wise.3. How Desk Check Helps with Time and Cost SavingPrevents Back-and-ForthOne of the biggest pain points in development is the constant iteration loop. A design might get built out and then reviewed, only to find discrepancies that require another round of adjustments. These cycles can take up valuable time and add unnecessary stress to everyone involved.Desk Check helps to reduce this back-and-forth by addressing design issues in real-time while the UI is still in the dev environment. Instead of waiting for the entire build to be complete before spotting discrepancies, you’re able to catch issues early in the process, preventing major revisions down the line.Reduces ReworkWhen designs are closely reviewed during development, the likelihood of needing significant rework is minimized. If a misalignment or color inconsistency is spotted early, it can be corrected before it becomes part of the larger build. This means that developers aren’t wasting time on fixes that should have been caught earlier, and they can focus on refining the code instead.By focusing on small details during the Desk Check process, you reduce the need for large-scale adjustments, ultimately leading to a more efficient development cycle.Improved Quality ControlDesk Check also serves as a quality control mechanism. It ensures that the design specifications are followed precisely, which results in a more polished final product. When the implementation matches the design exactly, it reflects well on the product as a whole—leading to higher user satisfaction ",Darwin,,Zensar Technologies,No,,Yes,"4. How to Conduct a Desk CheckStep-by-Step GuideConducting a Desk Check is straightforward but requires focus. Here’s a step-by-step guide you can follow:Set Up Your Review EnvironmentOpen the development environment (QA environment, staging, etc.) and ensure you’re looking at the latest version of the app or site.Pull up your design files in Figma (or whichever tool you use) so you can compare them side by side.Review Layout and SpacingCheck the alignment of all elements, ensuring that spacing between elements (margins, paddings, and gaps) matches your design.Ensure that the layout is responsive, and check how elements behave on different screen sizes.Verify TypographyDouble-check font sizes, line heights, and weights for headings, paragraphs, and other text elements.Make sure the typography is consistent across screens and matches the design specs.Check Colors and Visual ElementsVerify that the colors in the UI match the design file. This includes background colors, button colors, and text colors.Ensure icons, images, and other visual elements have the right color contrast and are correctly aligned with your design.Review Interactive ElementsEnsure all buttons, links, and hover states behave as expected.Check any animations or transitions to ensure they match your design specifications.Document FeedbackUse the commenting feature in Figma (or your preferred tool) to leave feedback directly on the design file. Be as specific as possible: e.g., ""Button padding too large,"" ""Font weight is too light,"" or ""Color doesn’t match.""Real-World Example or Case StudyIn a recent project, we were working on a website design for a client. The first version of the website that came out of development had several issues with button alignment, font sizes, and spacing. These weren’t huge issues but would have required major revisions if not caught early.By implementing Desk Check, I was able to catch these issues before the app was fully developed. I spent a couple of hours reviewing the design in the QA environment and left detailed comments on the design file. The development team was able to make quick fixes without needing to redo large portions of the app.This early intervention helped us save time, as we avoided a round of rework and the client’s launch schedule was not delayed. The project was delivered on time, with minimal back-and-forth, and the client was thrilled with the final product.7. ConclusionThe Desk Check process is a simple but highly effective method for ensuring that your designs are translated into code accurately. By carefully reviewing the UI in the development environment, designers can maintain control over the user experience, prevent costly mistakes, and ultimately deliver a higher-quality product.By catching discrepancies early, Desk Check saves time and money, reduces rework, and improves collaboration between design and d",,"Qualitative Impact:{Qualitative Impact,External}","Realised so far:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}","Projected Annually:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}",Yes,82,

This system revolutionizes the process of tyre production by ensuring precise uniformity of the green tyres before the curing stage.By accurately measuring radial force and runout in the green tyre, the system compares these values against a derived GT (Green Tyre) specification limit and uses logically derived formulas to automatically make corrections when deviations are detected.In addition to its corrective capabilities, the system features real time monitoring and tracking of the uniformity of each tyre throughout production. If any tyre is off the specified GT uniformity limits, the system generates alerts, allowing for quick intervention of the user to prevent defects. The system plays a pivotal role in improving Overalll Uniformity Yield, OE Yield especially for the OEMs with stringent uniformity requirements and promotes First TIme Right approach. It also ensures smoother operations and eliminates delays caused due to TBMs waiting for initial lot uniformity checks.",Darwin," Mukul Bar (mukul.bar@ceat.com), Selvakumar Thangarasu (selvakumar.t@ceat.com)",CEAT,No, Sharath Velumani (sharath.velumani@ceat.com),No,1)Integrating Green Tyre Uniformity System with VMI Tyre Building MAchine (TBM) presented a complex challenge. The VMI machine's existing systems needed to work seamlessly with the new measurement and correction systems without disturbing the production flow or causing delays.2)Accurate Positioning of Laser Unit and Load cell into the Center roller shaft was a challenge in itslef.These lasers are required to be accurately aligned radially with the TBM shate to ensure the measurements are taken at the correct locations on the tread. The same goes for load cell positioning as well.3)A significant technical hurdle was to establish a linear correlation between the cured tyre (CT) and Green Tyre (GT) radial force and runout values.This was crucial to ensure that the measurements taken during the green tyre stage could accurately predict performance and uniformity in the cured tyre.4) Waveform pattern matching was also a crucial challenge. It is not only matching the waveforms of the green tyres to those of the cured tyres but also involved removal of various noise generated at the green tyre (GT) stage. This is done to ensure accurate comparison with Cured Tyre(CT) and uniformity analysis at the green tyre stage. This is also done as the corrections are being done automatically and any noise would compromise on the accuracy level of the correction.5)A key challenge was to arrive at accurate algorithms that could dynamically adjust the parameters of the VMI Tyre Building Machine (TBM)  in real-time.6)Training Associates to understand and effectively utilize the new system was crucial.

These AI-driven digital representations act as virtual assistants or customer support agents, addressing various challenges in the domain. Here's how they are being utilized:1. 24/7 Customer Support -  Traditional customer service models struggle to offer consistent support across time zones.Digital avatars provide round-the-clock assistance, reducing dependency on human agents and ensuring uninterrupted service availability. They can handle FAQs, troubleshoot issues, and escalate complex problems to human representatives.2. Personalized Interactions - Generic customer service experiences can feel impersonal and ineffective.Avatars analyze customer data to deliver tailored responses, making interactions more engaging and context-aware. For instance, an avatar could remember a customer’s preferences or past interactions to enhance satisfaction.3. Improved User Engagement - Text-based or voice-only interactions can lack a sense of connection.By incorporating facial expressions and natural language processing (NLP), digital avatars create more lifelike and engaging interactions, fostering trust and loyalty.4. Scalability and Cost Efficiency - Scaling human customer support teams is expensive and resource-intensive.Digital avatars can handle a high volume of simultaneous interactions, significantly reducing operational costs while maintaining high service quality with human in loop5. Omnichannel Integration - Customers engage with brands across multiple platforms, leading to fragmented experiences.Avatars seamlessly integrate across channels—such as websites, apps, and social media, kiosks —offering consistent service and tracking interactions to ensure continuity.6. Training and Upskilling Support Staff - Keeping human agents up-to-date on new products or processes can be time-consuming.Avatars can simulate customer scenarios, helping train and upskill human agents in handling diverse queries effectively. We can also use multiple sub-agents to provide additional information to the avatarsReal-world ApplicationsBanking: Banks use digital avatars to guide customers through complex processes like loan applications or investment planning.Retail: Avatars assist shoppers with personalized product recommendations, virtual try-ons, and resolving post-purchase queries.Healthcare: Virtual assistants powered by avatars provide initial symptom assessments and appointment scheduling.BenefitsFaster query resolution.Enhanced customer satisfaction through interactive and empathetic responses.Cost-effective scaling for global operations.Digital avatars in customer service not only streamline operations but also elevate customer experience, making them a cornerstone of modern service strategies",Greenball, Prashanth Raja (p.raja@zensar.com),Zensar Technologies,Yes,,Yes,,,"Qualitative Impact:{Qualitative Impact,External}","Realised so far:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}","Projected Annually:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}",Yes,20,

was requirement of solid-/pneumatic tyre for Sci-Fi Action movie Vehicle

Outer
Dia: 50 Inches

Width:
560 mm 

Inner

We
initially proposed our 560/60R22.5 RT tyre, which matched the OD & width
criteria.

But
with the rim it was unlikely as they shared the Vehicle representation image
for reference.



So,
it was decided to develop a Non Std tyre as per their requirement.

This
was a challenging task, as this tyre was customized and not as per any STDs,
also the vehicle type was different compared to all other OTR machineries.

We
designed the tyre and simulated the same to carry specified load and inflation
pressure was given by CEAT.

industrialisation machinery limitations, modifications were conducted to meet
the specification limit to develop 560/30R40.5

* The pattern requirement was a chain type pattern similar to their
metal prototype.* Achieving
pattern like their expectations was challenging as it should provide necessary
traction for mobility which was difficult with the chains.* Pattern was finalized after multiple iterations with the look
confirmation and then optimizing the final look pattern to provide its product
characteristics.INDUSTRIALIZATION: * Green tyre was touching the mould cavity due to lower aspect ratio
which was overcome by loading at minimum shaping pressure.

development of our vendor portal, we encountered several challenges that
required strategic solutions. One major hurdle was integrating the portal with
our existing ERP systems and legacy tools, which involved significant
customization to ensure seamless data synchronization and real-time updates. As
the portal expanded to accommodate more vendors and transactions, scalability
became a concern, necessitating robust infrastructure to maintain consistent
performance and uptime.

User adoption
posed another significant challenge. Many vendors had varying levels of
technical expertise, and some resisted transitioning to the new system.
Training and support required considerable resources to ensure effective usage.
Internally, we also faced resistance from team members accustomed to
traditional communication methods, making stakeholder alignment and change
management critical.

Maintaining
data accuracy and consistency was essential but challenging, as discrepancies
in vendor details, order statuses, or performance metrics could lead to
inefficiencies and disputes. Designing the portal to meet the diverse needs of
our vendors while maintaining simplicity and usability added complexity.

Cybersecurity
was a top priority, as the portal managed sensitive information such as
purchase orders, pricing, and supplier performance metrics. Implementing robust
security measures and ensuring compliance with regional data privacy
regulations was both critical and resource intensive.

The
integration of ERP systems with vendors was also a challenge, as some vendors
do not have proper ERP systems in place, complicating the development in
Integration.

We also
encountered challenges in resource allocation and cost management. Furthermore,
encouraging vendors to use the portal consistently required continuous
engagement and the demonstration of clear value. Some vendors preferred
traditional communication methods that initially diluted the portal’s
efficiency.

Despite these
challenges, through proactive planning, robust technology, and effective
collaboration, we successfully addressed these issues, ensuring the portal’s

attendance records for contract labor and third-party employees is entirely
manual. This traditional process has created several challenges, including
time-consuming payroll processing, data inaccuracy, and difficulty in long-term
data retention. The existing manual system has a high potential for errors and
manipulation, resulting in inefficiencies, inaccuracies, and frustration for HR
and payroll teams. Therefore, the goal of this project is to digitalize the
attendance recording system, eliminating these issues and improving the overall
efficiency and accuracy of attendance management.Challenges with Current Manual Attendance System:


 Time-Consuming
     Payroll Processing: Manual attendance recording makes the payroll
     process lengthy, requiring substantial time and resources for calculating
     wages and overtime.
 Difficulty
     in Long-Term Data Retention: Storing and accessing historical
     attendance data manually is cumbersome and prone to data loss or
     mismanagement.
 Reconciliation
     Errors: Manual methods increase the chances of errors during
     attendance reconciliation, which can lead to discrepancies in records and
     payroll issues.
 Risk
     of Attendance Manipulation: The manual system is vulnerable to
     attendance manipulation, either by employees or staff, leading to false
     records.
 Frequent
     Errors in Manual Attendance: Consistent mistakes in manual entry and
     tracking make it challenging to rely on the data for accurate
     decision-making.
 Time-Consuming
     Tracking: The process of tracking, verifying, and reconciling
     attendance is repetitive, tedious, and prone to delays, making it a burden
     on HR personnel.                                               Efforts to Implement the Digitalization System:
 System
     Design & Customization: A digital attendance tracking system is
     designed to cater to the unique needs of third-party employees and
     contract labour. This system is included biometric and/or RFID-based
     clock-in/clock-out features for accuracy.
 Integration
     with Payroll System: The attendance system is integrated with software
     to automate overtime, and deductions, significantly reducing manual
     intervention.
 Cloud-Based
     Data Storage: The system will utilize cloud technology to store
     attendance data securely, making it easily accessible for long-term
     storage and retrieval, while ensuring compliance with data privacy
     regulations.
 Automated
     Reconciliation: Automated reconciliation features will be implemented
     to reduce errors, enhance accuracy, and save time by cross-verifying
     attendance records against set rules and policies.
 Audit
     and Monitoring: The system will include audit trials and real-time
     monitoring, making it easier to detect discrepancies and prevent
     fraudulent activities like attendance manipulation.
 User
     Training & Support: Comprehensive training sessions is provided to
     HR and payroll teams, ensuring smooth adoption of the new system and
     minimizing resistance to change.

",Darwin, Kartick Patra (kartick.patra@rpgls.com),RPG Life Sciences,Yes,,Yes,"Challenges in Digitalization:


 Initial
     Setup and Transition: Migrating from a manual to a digital system can
     be complex, requiring time, resources, and careful planning to ensure a
     smooth transition without disrupting operations.
 Resistance
     to Change: Employees and management accustomed to the traditional
     system may resist adopting new technology, requiring change management
     strategies to ensure acceptance.
 Data
     Security and Privacy: Handling sensitive employee data in a digital
     system requires robust security measures to protect against data breaches
     and ensure compliance with legal requirements.
 System
     Integration: Integrating the new digital attendance system with
     existing payroll and HR systems can be technically challenging, requiring
     coordination between different departments and vendors.Training and Adoption: Ensuring that all users are fully trained and
comfortable with the new system may take time and continuous support",Digitalisation of Attendance system for Third party and  contract labour.docx,"Qualitative Impact:{Qualitative Impact,Internal},{Remarks,<p class=""MsoNormal""><b>&#160;Outcomes Expected from Digitalization:</b></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&#10;&#10;</p><ol start=""1"" type=""1"">&#10; <li class=""MsoNormal""><b>Increased&#10;     Accuracy</b>: Automated attendance tracking is reduced human error,&#10;     leading to more accurate records.</li>&#10; <li class=""MsoNormal""><b>Time&#10;     and Cost Efficiency</b>: The payroll process will be significantly&#10;     shortened and streamlined, reducing administrative workload and costs.</li>&#10; <li class=""MsoNormal""><b>Improved&#10;     Data Accessibility</b>: Cloud storage will ensure easy access to&#10;     historical attendance records, improving data management and retrieval.</li>&#10; <li class=""MsoNormal""><b>Reduced&#10;     Fraud and Manipulation</b>: Biometric and RFID technology will prevent&#10;     attendance manipulation, ensuring that records are tamper-proof.</li>&#10; <li class=""MsoNormal"">&#160;It will save the time and effort of HR teams.</li></ol>}","Realised so far:{Unit,INR},{Amount,0},{Type,Cost Saving}","Projected Annually:{Unit,INR},{Amount,3000},{Type,Cost Saving}",Yes,97,

This digital persona will be designed to communicate effectively, recognising and responding to the emotional undertones in user interactions, thereby enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.To achieve this, the avatar will be powered by a robust integration with a large language model (LLM) backend. This advanced LLM integration is critical as it equips the digital avatar with the capability to process and understand a wide range of queries. Whether the questions are domain-specific or more general, the avatar will be able to provide accurate and contextually appropriate responses. This feature ensures that the avatar can serve a broad user base, addressing specific professional needs while also engaging in more casual, conversational interactions.Furthermore, the integration with the LLM enables the digital persona to learn from interactions, adapt its responses, and improve over time. This adaptive learning approach allows the avatar to become more personalized and effective in its interactions with each user, creating a more engaging and satisfying experience. By combining emotional intelligence and advanced computational abilities, the digital avatar will not only meet but exceed the capabilities of traditional digital assistants, setting a new standard for user interaction in digital platforms.This tool stands out because it integrates a large language model (LLM) to provide real-time, context-aware responses that adapt to the user's emotional state and content needs. Unlike conventional digital assistants that operate based on pre-defined scripts, this avatar learns and evolves, offering personalized interactions that feel more like communicating with a human than interacting with a program.Key FeaturesEmotional Intelligence: Ability to detect and respond to emotional cues, making interactions feel more natural and empathetic.Adaptive Learning: Learns from each interaction to improve responses and personalize the user experience.Broad Domain Responsiveness: Capable of handling inquiries across various domains, making it versatile for multiple use cases.Real-Time Processing: Integrates with LLM to process and respond to queries swiftly, ensuring a smooth and efficient user experience.",Darwin, Indrajit Kar (i.kar@zensar.com),Zensar Technologies,Yes,,Yes,"diction issues may arise sometimes, rendering of avatar takes a little time",,"Qualitative Impact:{Qualitative Impact,External},{Remarks,Enhanced user experience, higher engagement, increased customer satisfaction}","Realised so far:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}","Projected Annually:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}",Yes,99,

Sonawale.Description:Existing ProcessThe current system for managing canteen coupons is based
on paper-based physical coupons. The process includes the following steps:Coupon Distribution:  Employees receive physical coupons daily
or monthly. These coupons are manually distributed, often resulting in delays
or confusion during distribution.Coupon Redemption: Employees redeem their coupons by
presenting them at the canteen counter. The staff manually collects the coupons
and tracks the number of coupons used by each employee.Manual Tracking and Reporting: Canteen staff manually
maintain records of coupon distribution, usage, and balance. This requires
manual reconciliation at the end of the month, resulting in inaccuracies,
discrepancies, and long processing times.Reconciliation: At the end of each month, HR and
accounting teams manually reconcile the coupons issued with the canteen bills.
This process is prone to human error and fraud.Efforts
in DigitalizationFace
Recognition Integration:A face recognition system will be integrated into the
canteen’s infrastructure. Employees will be enrolled in the system by capturing
their facial images, which will be stored securely in a central database.Digital Coupon Allocation:The digital coupon data will be linked to the employee’s
facial profile, so each employee can redeem their coupons simply by
authentication through facial recognition.Cloud-Based Data Management:All data related to coupon issuance, usage, and employee
profiles will be securely stored on a cloud platform. This will ensure easy
access, long-term storage, and protection of sensitive employee information.Employee Training:Detailed training sessions will be provided to employees and
canteen staff on how to use the face recognition system. This will ensure that
all stakeholders are comfortable with the new process and understand its
benefits.Ongoing Technical Support:

































IT support teams will be available to address any technical
issues related to the face recognition system and provide troubleshooting as
required.",Darwin," Chinmaya Mohanty (chinmaya.mohanty@rpgls.com), Kartick Patra (kartick.patra@rpgls.com)",RPG Life Sciences,Yes,,Yes,"Challenges

Resistance to Change

Employees and canteen staff who are accustomed to the
traditional paper-based system may resist adopting the new digital system,
especially with the use of facial recognition. Clear communication, training,
and addressing concerns will be essential to overcome resistance.

Accuracy and Reliability of Face Recognition

While face recognition technology is highly accurate, there
can be challenges related to varying lighting conditions, employee appearance
changes (e.g., facial hair, glasses), and potential false rejections or
acceptances. Ensuring that the system performs well in different environments
will be crucial.

Infrastructure and Hardware Costs

Initial investment in the necessary hardware and software
infrastructure will be required. This may include upgrades to the existing
canteen systems to integrate with facial recognition technology.

Integration with Existing Systems

Integrating the face recognition system with existing HR,
payroll, and canteen management systems may present technical challenges.

addressed.",Digitalization of canteen coupon sytem.docx,"Qualitative Impact:{Qualitative Impact,Internal},{Remarks,<p class=""MsoNormal""><b>Expected Outcomes</b></p>&#10;&#10;<p class=""MsoNormal""><b>Increased Efficiency and Time Savings</b></p>&#10;&#10;<p class=""MsoNormal"">The manual processes of coupon distribution, usage tracking,&#10;and reporting will be replaced with automated systems, significantly reducing&#10;the time spent on administrative tasks.</p>&#10;&#10;<p class=""MsoNormal""><b>Enhanced Accuracy</b></p>&#10;&#10;<p class=""MsoNormal"">With face recognition technology, the chances of errors in&#10;coupon redemption and tracking will be minimized, ensuring that records are&#10;accurate and tamper-proof.</p>&#10;&#10;<p class=""MsoNormal""><b>Real-Time Data Access and Reporting</b></p>&#10;&#10;<p class=""MsoNormal"">The system will provide real-time tracking of coupon&#10;issuance and usage.

Common issues include missing markings and half markings, which have led to complaints from major customers from MG and MSIL.  Describe - Currently, there is no system available to check uniformity marking at the uniformity machine itself. As a result, tyres are often rejected after reaching the warehouse, leading to high PDI rejection rates. Additionally, the PDI process is manual and relies heavily on human oversight, increasing the probability of tyres with marking issues reaching the market. This has resulted in a higher incidence of customer complaints. Developing a vision camera system will automate and improve the accuracy of the inspection process, reducing both PDI rejections and customer complaints.Solution :The solution combines advanced computer vision techniques, AI-powered algorithms, and visual analytics to detect and monitor the presence of these marks on tyres, helping manufacturers streamline their dispatch processes, improve accuracy, and minimize human error.",Darwin, Sajeesh Kumar Kandambeth (sajeesh.kumar@ceat.com),CEAT,No, Puwar Pradipsinhyogendrasinh (pradipsinh.puvar@ceat.com),Yes,"A.

(REMS) process is critical for ensuring the safe usage of certain drugs.
However, the existing framework often proves cumbersome, requiring patients of
all age groups to navigate manual processes involving call centers for
compliance enrollment, feedback submission, and adverse effect reporting. This
results in high operational costs, limited accessibility, and inefficiencies
that hinder patient engagement. To address these challenges, we propose a
next-generation digital companion app designed to revolutionize REMS compliance
by incorporating end-to-end automation, accessibility, and real-time
interaction capabilities.

 

We propose to leverage ECHO framework which
is designed to address enterprise challenges by streamlining operations and
improving customer engagement. 

 

 

The proposed solution leverages
accessibility-first principles to enable patients to engage with the app
through voice, text, or their preferred language, ensuring inclusivity across
demographics. Core features include easy enrollment through automated form-filling,
interactive digital medical guides for education, and a digital checklist for
drug dispensing. Advanced automation will streamline routine processes, such as
auto-scheduling tests, generating FDA-compliant forms, and automating the
filing of adverse effects. The app will also feature an AI-powered REMS avatar
for patient education, symptom analysis, and risk prediction, alongside
real-time query handling, significantly reducing the burden on healthcare
providers while empowering patients.

 

To enhance patient adherence and
engagement, the app will include features like medicine reminders, test result
acknowledgments, and a personalized health dashboard. Patients will gain
insights into their compliance status and its impact on overall health,
fostering a sense of ownership. Additionally, the app will integrate social
media nudges showcasing success stories from other patients, driving motivation
and awareness. By enabling easy access to appointments during free slots and
providing proximity-based suggestions, the solution ensures seamless healthcare
delivery.

 

 

By addressing the challenges of patient
education, operational inefficiencies, and compliance complexities, this
innovative companion app will redefine how REMS programs are operationalized.
Through automation, AI-driven insights, and a user-friendly interface, the app
promises to reduce bottlenecks, ensure higher compliance rates, and
significantly improve drug monitoring, ultimately leading to better patient
outcomes and enhanced healthcare efficiencies.",Darwin," Gayathri N V S (gayathri.nvs@zensar.com), Sriram Venkatakrishnan (v.sriram@zensar.com)",Zensar Technologies,Yes,,Yes,- Customizing the solution to understand the domain specific terminology of medical process- End to End automation without manual intervention is a challenge,,"Qualitative Impact:{Qualitative Impact,External},{Remarks,<ul type=""disc"">&#10; <li class=""MsoNormal"">Improved Patient Education<span>&#8203;</span></li>&#10;</ul>&#10;&#10;<p class=""MsoNormal"">&#160;</p>&#10;&#10;<ul type=""disc"">&#10; <li class=""MsoNormal"">Faster Query Handling<span>&#8203;</span></li>&#10;</ul>&#10;&#10;<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>&#8203;</span></p>&#10;&#10;<ul type=""disc"">&#10; <li class=""MsoNormal"">Automation of contact center case filing&#10;     to FDA for Adverse effect<span>&#8203;</span></li>&#10;</ul>&#10;&#10;<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>&#8203;</span></p>&#10;&#10;<ul type=""disc"">&#10; <li class=""MsoNormal"">Proactive health monitoring<span>&#8203;</span></li>&#10;</ul>&#10;&#10;<p class=""MsoNormal"">&#160;</p>&#10;&#10;<ul type=""disc"">&#10; <li class=""MsoNormal"">Ensuring adherence to safety protocols<span>&#8203;</span></li>&#10;</ul>&#10;&#10;<p class=""MsoNormal"">&#160;</p>&#10;&#10;<ul type=""disc"">&#10; <li class=""MsoNormal"">Improve pharmacist&#8217;s efficiency in&#10;     dispensing drugs<span>&#8203;</span></li>}","Realised so far:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}","Projected Annually:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}",Yes,47,

Application Builder is an innovative Low-Code/No-Code platform designed to
rapidly create and deploy complex web application forms and data listing pages.
This tool was developed to replace a costly and restrictive third-party
Portfolio Management system, used by over 4,000 users, which incurred
significant licensing fees and suffered from long enhancement cycles. By
leveraging a metadata-driven architecture and a JSON-based configuration model,
the platform enabled the rapid delivery of a modern, scalable web application
that spans project initiation to invoicing and accounting integration.

The first phase of
the project successfully delivered a fully functional application with numerous
screens and listing pages in record time, instilling confidence in the business
to fund subsequent phases. This achievement set the stage for the complete decommissioning
of the legacy third-party tool, unlocking significant cost savings and
operational efficiencies.

Machine (TBM) because of damaged finger springs. In Tyre building machine (TBM)
the Finger System is with single spring mounting assembly on each finger and during
Bead application due to more load and tension on finger springs assembly, their
mounting gets loose and due to this, fingers were not equally opening and
closing which damages the spring & the sharp end of the spring pierces into
the bladder leading to bladder burst.In the new system we innovatated and designed a double

an integral part of tyre manufacturing process. The band is made on an
equipment called Band Building Machine. In the band making process ply is applied in
opposite direction with squeeze over each ply.

 

The innovation is about to eliminate pneumatic
hand operated solenoid valve operations which lead to hazardous safety related
issues on band building machine. 

The solenoid valves were used to operate band
fabric table, Top/ Bottom squeeze roll, bottom stitcher roll. 

Process: The process is like that when fabric table comes forward by
operating a pneumatic hand valve (Fig. 1) & touches the main drum, the
operator can make the band by applying fabric over the drum & then rotating
the drum by pressing a foot pedal. Next operation is to apply inner & outer
liner on the band. For which there are pneumatic hand valve operated Top &
Bottom Squeeze rolls respectively which also comes in-contact with the drum to
apply the liner. Last operation after making the band is to apply a pneumatic
hand valve operated back stitcher which touches the band over the drum to
remove the entrapped air from the band.

 

Problem 1: There were high chances that while making the band the back
stitcher also remain applied (Fig. 3) if the back stitcher hand valve is ON.
Which may lead to hand getting pinched between the drum & back stitcher.

Problem 2: There were high chances that while operating top &
bottom squeeze rolls for applying inner & outer liner respectively on the
band, operator hand gets pinched between the drum & the squeeze rolls. Even
after pulling the safety rope, the machine gets turned off but the rolls remain
in their actuated position as they are operated through pneumatic hand (manually
operated) valves which cannot be turned OFF by pulling the rope.

 

Innovation 1: Converted hand operated pneumatic valves to
electrically operated solenoid valves (Fig. 2) & provided interlock in the
PLC that when fabric table is in forward position, back stitcher will not
operate (Fig. 4). Which eliminated the chance of hand getting pinched between
the drum & back stitcher.

 

Innovation 2: Converted hand operated pneumatic valves to
electrically operated solenoid valves & now when the safety rope is pulled
the valves also get turned off along with the machine & the rolls which are
operated through the valves goes to their home position. ",Darwin, Uttam Wagh (uttam.wagh@ceat.com),CEAT,No, Vijay Sharma (vijay.sharma@ceat.com),No,"1)     Intermittent air

were awarded the substation project in Zolapur, Ahmedabad by PGCIL. However,
during the execution phase, the client did not allocate the land for
constructing the project. At the same time, there was pressure from the client
to begin the supply process for revenue purposes. We also needed to meet our
revenue targets as per the annual goals. As a result, the client allocated
nearby land in Khandhagam, Vadodara.

After the final land clearance, the logistics team
faced a significant challenge in transferring the materials from Khandhagam,
Vadodara to the actual project site in Zolapur, Ahmedabad. The project team
requested a comprehensive logistics solution, as the materials were becoming
damaged due to temporary storage.

Our goal was to efficiently relocate the materials
from Khandhagam to Zolapur. The project involved repacking, handling,
transportation, and unloading processes to ensure the timely and safe delivery
of goods, while addressing any potential challenges along the way.

Project Objectives:


 Streamline and optimize material handling to reduce costs and time.
 Ensure the safety and integrity of materials throughout the
     process.
 Minimize environmental impact by using sustainable logistics
     practices.
 Innovate logistics processes with advanced tools, technology, and

congregations and cultural activities. Current challenges may include:

Lack of Landscaping: Factory area have not properly landscaped
surroundings that contribute to the peaceful, tranquil environment conducive to
spiritual practices.

 

",Solstice, Yugal Sikri (yugal.sikri@rpgls.com),RPG Life Sciences,Yes,,No,"Challenges Encountered

Space Constraints

The factory premises may have limited available land for the
temple and landscaping, especially given that space is needed for production
operations, safety infrastructure, and employee facilities. The challenge was
to find a balance between a spacious temple and the factory’s core operational
needs.

Budget Constraints

While the creation of the temple and landscaping is a
valuable investment, the project must be managed within budget constraints.
Securing adequate funding and ensuring cost-efficiency during the construction
and landscaping phases has been a significant challenge.

Environmental Factors

Weather conditions, particularly during the landscaping
phase, can delay the progress. Additionally, the choice of plants and trees

Title:  Notification Engine

Problem:
In many projects, clients rely on periodic pull mechanisms like email or Webex to stay updated on system statuses. Sometimes it could be periodic system check and notifying customers pushes However, this approach leads to inefficiencies as clients often receive more information than they need, increasing system load.

Solution:
Implement a publisher-subscriber model to replace pull mechanisms with real-time push notifications. Clients subscribe to specific events of interest, and the system sends updates instantly when relevant conditions are met. This reduces unnecessary queries, making the system more responsive and efficient.

Benefits:
    Real-Time Updates: Users receive notifications as soon as events occur, improving responsiveness.
    Customization: Clients can subscribe to specific types of updates tailored to their needs, enhancing user experience.
    Scalability: The system becomes more scalable and adaptable with a loosely coupled architecture, accommodating growth seamlessly.
    Reduced Load: Minimizes unnecessary system load caused by periodic client queries, optimizing resource utilization.

This notification engine not only enhances user satisfaction by delivering timely and relevant information but also boosts system performance by streamlining communication and reducing overhead.",Greenball, Sandeep Deshmukh (s.deshmukh4@zensar.com),Zensar Technologies,, Sai Krishna Cindula (sai.cindula@zensar.com),,,,,"Realised so far:{Amount,}","Projected Annually:{Amount,}",Yes,,

Environmental Responsibility:

Concrete waste from foundation work, which is
typically disposed of on land, were used to make concrete planters. This
solution also fulfilled our EHS policy objective of optimizing the use of
resources to prevent the pollution. Additionally, the generated plastic wastes (Mostly
plastic bottles) at our sites and offices are collected and sold at recycling facilities
in exchange of money. The money is later reinvested in purchasing trees, which
were subsequently planted in our reused concrete planters.

 

Social Impact:

To extend the impact of this initiative, we
engaged with the local community through tree distribution programs. And by
providing these trees, we have developed a positive relation between our
organization and community, while promoting environmental wellbeing.

 

Governance Excellence:

By leveraging Smartsheet’s REST API, businesses can set up event-driven triggers that automatically push updates to downstream systems in real time, ensuring that data is always current and eliminating the need for batch processing. This solution allows for seamless synchronization between Smartsheet and other tools, such as CRMs, data warehouses, or analytics platforms, enabling businesses to take immediate action based on the latest information.
The process works by setting up webhooks or event listeners within the Smartsheet platform, which monitor for specific changes like row updates, sheet modifications, or task completions. Once an event is detected, the data is sent via the REST API to the target system in real time, allowing for instant updates without delays. This minimizes data lag and improves the overall responsiveness of business processes, especially in fast-paced environments where real-time data is crucial, such as project management, sales tracking, and inventory management.
With this method, businesses can achieve more accurate reporting, faster decision-making, and improved collaboration across teams by ensuring that all stakeholders are working with the latest information at any given moment.

flexible and efficient solution for managing data across diverse data sources,
including NoSQL collections (MongoDB) and relational database tables (SQL
Server). By dynamically generating schemas at runtime, FlexiAPI
eliminates the need for creating separate APIs for basic CRUD (Create, Read,
Update, Delete) operations, significantly reducing development effort and
maintenance overhead.

 

This innovative solution powers the no-code
capabilities to offer dynamic mapping and seamless integration with web
application components, such as Table Components for rendering data dynamically,
and supports the generation of scripts for data migration and report creation
across SQLServer Database and MongoDB. FlexiAPI is a cornerstone of
modern, scalable application architecture, enabling the application to manage
diverse data structures with ease and agility.Why FlexiAPI is a Game-ChangerFlexiAPI
redefines how modern web applications manage and interact with diverse data
sources by providing a unified, schema-driven API framework. Its ability to
dynamically generate schemas and adapt to changing data structures eliminates
the traditional bottlenecks of API development and maintenance.By powering dynamic mapping, data
migration, and report generation, FlexiAPI serves as the backbone of a modern,
scalable web application that is slated to replace the 3rd party legacy
packaged solution, enabling significant licensing cost savings. It empowers to
achieve greater agility, reduce costs, and ensure data consistency, making it
an essential tool for undergoing digital transformation.

In automotive vehicles generally, a pneumatic or air filled tyre used in most vehicles or other industrial applications comprises a tread, bead, sidewall, shoulder, and ply. The tread is the part of the tyre that comes in contact with the road surface. The tyre bead is the part of the tire that contacts the rim of the wheel. The characteristic feature of the pneumatic tyre is the use of air-filled chamber between the rim and the tread that support the tread of the tire.However, pneumatic tires suffer some disadvantages. For example1.    Pneumatic tyres or Air based tyres are susceptible to punctures which results in flats and requires immediate repair or replacement.2.        Also, maintenance requirements like regular inflation is a must for pneumatic tires.3.        Besides, extreme temperatures can also affect the air pressure in pneumatic tires, potentially leading to overinflation or underinflation.4.        In some extreme situations, pneumatic tires are also vulnerable to blowouts.5.        Furthermore, the production and disposal of pneumatic tyres, owing to their relatively shorter life as compared to non-pneumatic tyres, can have environmental consequences as old tires may lead to waste management challenges. Thus, there existed a need for a tyre that counters the above-mentioned shortcomings of pneumatic tyres. So, we at CEAT have come up with a tangential non-pneumatic tyre (TNPT) or the CEAT’s own India’s first : Made in India, Made for world – Airless Tyre prototype that addresses the deficiencies of the conventional pneumatic tyres, in particular, provides a durable, temperature insensitive, low maintenance, and puncture resistance tyre.Currently the product is in design validation stage and prototypes are ready.",NeoStar, Renji Issac (renji.issac@rpg.in),CEAT,No," Nidil C P (nidil.cp@ceat.com), Prashant Dholiya (prashant.dholiya@ceat.com)",No,"The development of airless, non-pneumatic tyres, particularly the tangential non-pneumatic tyre (TNPT) presents a number of technical and engineering challenges. Some key challenges faced during the development could include:Entirely New engineering : Since it is an entirely new field of engineering and with very limited literature availability it has been the biggest challenge to start and build up the concept and design of Airless tyreManufacturing Complexity: The manufacturing process involves intricate steps, such as creating multiple circular rings from metal wire and rubber, then curing them between the rim and the outer belt layer. Achieving consistency and precision in the production process is challenging, especially when scaling up for mass production.Spoke Arrangement and Design: The specific spoke design, where each spoke is offset from the others, introduces complexities in both the design and manufacturing stages. Structure and Load-Bearing Capacity: Ensuring that the arrangement of spokes and their configuration can effectively bear the load of the vehicle without compromising performance. Achieving load distribution similar to or better than traditional pneumatic tyres while maintaining durability is a significant challenge.Material Selection: Choosing the right materials for the spokes, the circular rings, and the rubber coatings was crucial. The materials must offer the necessary strength, flexibility, and wear resistance, Balancing these qualities in a cost-effective manner is a challegeDurability : Preventing premature wear, ensuring longevity, and avoiding deformation under heavy use or extreme conditions are key challenges. However it is very initial stage to test the tyre hence additional field challenges like heat and thermal management, braking, noise will be looked upon equally",Patent Application.pdf,"Qualitative Impact:{Qualitative Impact,External},{Remarks,<p class=""MsoNormal""><b>1.

to the large companies. However, they lack the affordable tools for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Since,
SME's often lack the resources, expertise, or
tools to effectively manage their financial planning, leading to inefficiencies
in revenue management, tax compliance, liquidity analysis, and investment
decisions. These financial institutions can create “A Digital Twin for
Financial Planning for SME’s” platform which creates a virtual replica of
an SME’s financial ecosystem, enabling real-time insights and predictive
analytics. This tool empowers SMEs to make data-driven decisions, optimize cash
flow, and ensure compliance, serving as an all-in-one financial management
solution..

 

Problem Statement


 Limited
     Financial Expertise: SMEs often lack dedicated financial experts or resources to analyze
     revenue patterns, manage taxes, and optimize cash flow.
 Inefficient
     Cash Flow Management: Poor visibility into working capital and liquidity leads to
     suboptimal decisions, increasing the risk of cash crunches.
 Time-Consuming
     Tax Compliance: Navigating
     complex tax regulations without proper tools leads to errors, penalties,
     and inefficiencies.
 Lack
     of Investment Planning: Many SMEs struggle to allocate surplus funds effectively for growth
     or emergency needs.
 Fragmented
     Tools: SMEs
     often rely on multiple disconnected tools for accounting, taxation, and
     financial analysis, making management cumbersome.


 

Solution

 Data
     Integration: Aggregating
     data from multiple sources, such as accounting software, bank accounts,
     and payroll systems, requires robust integration frameworks.
 SME-Specific
     Customization: SMEs
     operate in diverse industries, necessitating a flexible solution that
     adapts to various business models and regulations.
 Data
     Privacy and Security: Ensuring sensitive financial data is securely stored and compliant
     with regulations like GDPR or CCPA.
 Cost
     Barrier for SMEs: Keeping the tool affordable while delivering advanced features is
     critical to adoption.
 Accuracy
     of Predictive Models: Developing reliable algorithms for revenue and cash flow
     forecasting depends on access to high-quality historical data.

These challenges include limited flexibility in making enhancements, which often requires significant time and resources to modify existing mappings. Additionally, maintaining data lineage can be cumbersome, making it difficult to track data flow and transformations throughout the pipeline.Proposed Solution: To address these issues, we have adopted a Python-based solution that runs on containers orchestrated by Kubernetes. This approach offers greater flexibility and ease of enhancement, allowing for more straightforward modifications to the ETL processes and enabling quicker responses to changing business requirements. The containerized environment ensures consistent execution and scalability, while Kubernetes manages the orchestration, providing robust deployment and monitoring capabilities.Moreover, the pipeline components were developed using modularization principles, maximizing reusability across different processes. This modular architecture allows us to easily integrate and repurpose components for various ETL tasks, significantly reducing development time and effort.Additionally, the Python solution enhances maintainability by providing clearer visibility into data lineage, facilitating better tracking and understanding of data transformations.

They want seamless integration of carbon-offsetting mechanisms into everyday financial transactions.The demand for sustainable financial products is on the rise. Over 60% of global consumers consider sustainability an important factor in their purchasing decisions, and financial services that integrate eco-friendly solutions are projected to see significant growth in the coming years.Solution: This integrates carbon-offset calculations into each payment transaction. When a customer makes a purchase, the system estimates the transaction’s carbon footprint and automatically funds a corresponding micro-offset contribution toward verified environmental projects (e.g., reforestation, renewable energy). Users can view their collective impact through their financial statements or banking app, while financial institutions handle project verification and funding allocation.Key features:Carbon Footprint Calculation: Based on transaction details, an emissions model will be used to estimate the carbon footprint associated with the transaction. For example, a purchase of goods might have an average carbon emission factor depending on the product category.Offset Amount Determination & Automatic Micro-Contribution:  The system converts the estimated carbon emissions into a corresponding “offset” value. This is typically measured in carbon credits or fractions thereof and applies a micro-contribution—funded either by a small portion of the transaction fee, a dedicated green fee the customer opts into, or by the financial institution as a value-added service. Investment into Verified Projects: The collected funds from these micro-contributions are aggregated and directed to certified environmental initiatives. Certification and Tracking: The institution receives documentation confirming the amount of carbon offsets purchased, which correspond to the aggregated customer transactions. User Feedback Loop:Customers can view their personal “carbon offset impact” through their banking app or statements. Potential Quantitative Impact for Zensar:·

Application login to the Gmail account using UI for the verification. Since the automation code is running multiple scenarios for multiple users in parallel, the Gmail triggers the authentication code which goes on the email of QA individual and results in failure of automation.Idea is to use Gmail API and generate a token which can be kept of shared repository so that automation code can use it and execute without triggering authentication code and failing. ",Darwin, Sai Hota (s.hota@zensar.com),Zensar Technologies,Yes,,Yes,"•In
application, there are multiple scenarios like issuing badges, discounts,
instructor class creation etc. where an email is sent to the user’s personal
email account

•For
testing purposes, today a Gmail account is used for all those purposes

•While
running the automation for multiple learners in parallel, the application has
to login to Gmail account using UI for verification. This is triggering the
security concerns on Gmail account like confirming the security code (sent on
mobile associated with the account)

•Back
in days, this issue was not very frequent but currently we are getting this
problem almost every other day•Person
running the testing automation is dependent on the individual who is getting
the security code (onsite / offshore)

•By
the time code is retrieved and used, the automation scripts fail (as it has
time limit to wait and there is no guarantee on how much time will it take to
retrieve the code from recipient)

•So,
we have
to
manually validate the code and verify the emails and run rest of the remaining
testing scenarios in the automation suit•In
current setup where UI is used, whenever the script fails, a screenshot comes
in the report for the failure. Once we start using API, there will be no
screenshot, and we will have to navigate logs to identify the issue

•Token
created by Gmail API is valid for 30 days. So, every month, we will have to
re-generate the token and upload it to the repository. This process takes 2
minutes but still a manual step",,"Qualitative Impact:{Qualitative Impact,External}","Realised so far:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}","Projected Annually:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}",Yes,12,

It is time-consuming, prone to errors, and challenging to identify qualified candidates efficiently.Time Constraints for Rapid Hiring:Urgent business demands often require fast hiring, leaving little time for a thorough evaluation of candidates. This rush can compromise the quality of the hiring process and lead to poor hiring decisions.Diverse Skill Set Requirements:Associate-level roles often require specific technical or physical skills, such as operating machinery or manual labor. Identifying candidates who meet these skill requirements from a large applicant pool is challenging and time-intensive.Geographical Disparities:Recruiting from multiple regions can create logistical challenges, including coordinating interviews, assessments, and travel arrangements. These factors can slow down the recruitment process and add to operational complexity.High Attrition Rates:Associate roles often experience high turnover due to factors like homesickness, job dissatisfaction, or better opportunities elsewhere. This constant cycle of hiring and attrition can stretch recruitment efforts and lead to inefficiencies.Ensuring Candidate Readiness:Many associate candidates may lack prior experience in specific industrial environments. Onboarding and training efforts to ensure candidates are job-ready can add to the recruitment timeline and increase costs.Limited Infrastructure for Assessments:Conducting technical assessments, psychometric evaluations, and aptitude tests for a large number of candidates can place a strain on existing infrastructure. Traditional recruitment setups may not be equipped to handle this scale effectively.Candidate Engagement and Experience:Maintaining a positive experience for all candidates, especially at scale, is essential for employer branding. Delays, lack of communication, or impersonal processes can lead to poor candidate experiences and damage the company’s reputation.Resistance to Digital Recruitment Solutions:Some candidates may not be familiar or comfortable with digital recruitment processes. This resistance to change can create barriers and result in disengagement from potential candidates.Compliance and Documentation Challenges:Ensuring compliance with industry standards, verifying documents, and collecting necessary credentials for a large number of candidates can be tedious. Managing these requirements under tight timelines may lead to inconsistencies and errors.",,"Qualitative Impact:{Qualitative Impact,External},{Remarks,<div class=""flex max-w-full flex-col flex-grow""><div dir=""auto"" class=""min-h-8 text-message flex w-full flex-col items-end gap-2 whitespace-normal break-words [.text-message+&amp;]:mt-5""><div class=""flex w-full flex-col gap-1 empty:hidden first:pt-[3px]""><div class=""markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light""><ul><li><div class=""flex max-w-full flex-col flex-grow""><div dir=""auto"" class=""min-h-8 text-message flex w-full flex-col items-end gap-2 whitespace-normal break-words [.text-message+&amp;]:mt-5""><div class=""flex w-full flex-col gap-1 empty:hidden first:pt-[3px]""><div class=""markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light""><ul><li></li><li>Improved Candidate Experience</li><li>Enhanced Candidate Fit</li><li>Efficient Talent Pool Management</li><li>Stronger Employer Branding</li><li>Improved Diversity and Inclusion</li><li>Increased Recruitment Transparency</li><li>Higher Retention Rates</li><li>Efficient Resource Allocation</li><li>Improved Onboarding Exper}","Realised so far:{Unit,INR},{Amount,400000},{Type,Cost Saving}","Projected Annually:{Unit,INR},{Amount,1200000},{Type,Cost Saving}",Yes,41,

materials from floor to floor.

5.    Minimum
time (3 to 4 mins. Per unit) for relocation by crane (Using spreader beam &
only vertical movement)

6.    Reduce
work at Height risk while working at edge protection. Less exposure of workmen at external platform comparing with conventional fall protection arrangement. 

7.    Ensure
productivity in mivan and aluminum formwork.

8.    Effective
barrier of fall protection after installation (for both person and object).9.   Effective control measure for exhaust dust from construction activities.10. Can control the wind pressure (limitation available).11. Reduces noise level. 12. Acts barrier between RCC wall and direct flow of air to avoid hair crack in RCC wall.13.

Statement

‘Preferred Channel of Engagement’ is always the primary focus for
any Bank. The advent of digital shifted focus from Branch to Mobile Banking.
Now a new frontier beckons which presents to power & possibilities to
combine to personal touch of a branch with tech features of Digital. Welcome to
‘Immersive Bank’

The Balance of money power is slowly shifting to the younger digital
generation. This new generation prefers the comfort & convenience of ‘As a
Service’ & ‘Do it Yourself’. Metaverse allows them to do both and where
done right will be a game change in the financial services world. 

We want to help banks envisioning the right pathway to creating a
Metaverse Banking channel.

Solution

Zensar proposes to help Financial institutions build a progressive
Immersive Experience to engage/partner with the customer in the journey to full
realization.

We propose below offerings for the same. Zensar with its expertise in Metaverse
will create multiple components / services that can be customized/enhanced
& embedded in the metaverse play thereby establishing a unique identity for
each bank and establishing appropriate presence as per bank preferences. Some
of the components / service line elements are listed below:

PI 1.      
Branding, activation campaigns, Marketing and Presales via Metaverse
lounge and V.As, Customer onboarding for CASA accounts and MFA based
security, in account Avatars

PI 2.      
Money movement, Bill pay and Card issuance, CASA Account operations

Operations of
Basic Home/Auto loans, Payment support for Wallets/ Digital Currency, CBDC and
Cryptocurrencies

Backend
Operations | Data-Driven Personalized campaigns and
sales

PI 3.      
Referrals (In/Cross
Metaverse): leading to A/C opening and/or purchase
of any banking product. Embedded Finance Products (In/Cross Metaverse and
multi-industry), Home/Auto/Student Loan, metaverses with embedded advisory,
credit and other VAS (title search, appraisal etc.)

In account
hyper-personalization and VAS - AIDAS/smart
assistant, budgeting and personal finance advisory | smart assistant for wealth
management, investments and HNIs

PI 4.      
Meta Market place - Extended as a BaaS offering

PI 5.      
P2P Loans, digital assets and
NFT lounge

This solution
will be through collaboration of Zenlabs & BFS-ISG (Industry Solutions
Group) units of Zensar. As listed above, the development is planned in an
iterative approach (PI = Product Iteration) providing agility to accommodate
changes on the go.

We are building this solution to be platform agnostic, it can be
accessed through smartphones, PCs or VR headsets. We are also looking at ways
to integrate this solution within commercially available metaverse and web3.0
platforms like spatial.io, Decentraland,
etc.The tech stack used is Unity3D and C#, which is the preferred
skillset for metaverse app development.
&#10",Greenball, Ashutosh Sharma (ashutosh.sharma@zensar.com),Zensar Technologies,Yes,,Yes,"These are early
days for companies to invest big on Metaverse & costs are high, while the
ROI from that investment is still questionable. Metaverse Tech is still
evolving – Jumping to early can result in negative outcomes (Experience &
Adoption). Also lack of regulation can be risk for certain features. Metaverse
does offer potential to hyper-personalize offerings with immersive experience,
but companies need to tread cautiously.

While
approaching the solution for implementing virtual banks in the metaverse, the
following are the points that are given special emphasis:

·       
Higher equipment costs- Individuals will have to buy the
technology for enhanced immersive experience, such as VR headsets, although simpler
access is possible through mobile/laptop.

·       
Governance and Compliances - Users may find it difficult to follow a specific approach and
intellectual property is essential to enforce licensing limitations and usage
rights with the involvement and expanding scope of the metaverse, which
currently appears to be lacking in the metaverse. 

·       
Interoperability -
between the virtual world and physical world as asset
mobility and fund transferring between virtual spaces and physical world have
constraints in metaverse due to connectivity gap between real and virtual
world.


·       
Privacy and Data Security - The nature of transaction should not be revealed subsequently before
and after and details in virtual identities are critical and should not change
on and after submission of data. 

·       
Identity Theft - 75% of respondents cited fraud as a reason to transfer banks.
Metaverse applications rely on secure identity management for avatar
interaction and service supply. Digital Identity includes more information than
a physical person. When users may use the same digital identity across
metaverse sites, criminality is easy.

·       
Financial Literacy - Customers require appropriate individualized exposure and
experience. The understanding of the finance system, services and offerings
provided by the institutes enable customers to increase their knowledge base
about its implementation in a virtual world.",,"Qualitative Impact:{Qualitative Impact,External},{Remarks,<p class=""MsoNormal""><b><span lang=""EN-US"">Brand Image</span></b></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><b><span lang=""EN-US"">Better Experience</span></b></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><b><span lang=""EN-US"">Personalized connect</span></b><b><span lang=""EN-US""></span></b></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><b><span lang=""EN"">Saving time&#160;</span></b><b><span lang=""EN-US""></span></b></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><b><span lang=""EN"">Reduce Operational Cost</span></b><b><span lang=""EN-US""></span></b></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><b><span lang=""EN"">Increase global reach</span></b><b><span lang=""EN""></span></b></p>}","Realised so far:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}","Projected Annually:{Unit,USD},{Amount,50000000},{Type,Impacting Revenue}",Yes,128,

This will improve communication, collaboration, and decision-making, while also reducing costs and safety risks. Although there are initial setup costs and potential technical challenges, the long-term benefits?such as remote monitoring, better resource management, and enhanced safety?make this investment valuable for ensuring the success of our construction projects. The system will capture 360-degree footage of the office environment for virtual tours, project discussions, and remote team collaboration. This footage can also be used for daily project reviews, such as team progress discussions and presentations.
To implement a VR camera at the construction site, which will provide a 360-degree view of daily activities, enabling remote monitoring from the office and facilitating project discussions, the following plan outlines both the benefits and challenges for presentation to the project team and stakeholder:
?	360-degree VR cameras will be installed at strategic locations on the construction site to capture panoramic footage of ongoing activities, worker operations, equipment, and site conditions.
?	The cameras will be connected to a cloud-based platform or server where footage will be stored and accessed remotely.
?	The footage will be accessible via VR headsets, desktop applications, or mobile devices that support 360-degree video viewing.
?	Daily video captures will be incorporated into project discussions, progress updates, and virtual walkthroughs during meetings.
?	Project team members and stakeholder can virtually ?walk? the site and observe activities, enabling them to make informed decisions.
Key Benefits:
?	Real-time site monitoring
?	Global accessibility
?	Virtual walkthroughs for Design Team, Management & stakeholders
?	Facilitating daily discussions
?	Reduced travel expenses
?	Site risk identification
?	Monitoring compliance
?	Efficient resource allocation

 During
     EHVCA (Extra High Voltage Cable Assembly) stress cone testing, GIS (Gas
     Insulated Switchgear) chambers are used.
 To
     seal both chambers in the middle, fasteners are employed, which requires
     approximately 10-15 minutes per cycle.
 This
     sealing process also affects the overall routine testing cycle.
 Each
     testing cycle currently takes about 1 hour, and fasteners are consumed
     monthly.


Innovation Description:


 The
     middle of the chamber has been modified by integrating a closing clamp
     device.
 This
     modification allows for quick sealing of the chamber, reducing the time
     required to close it to just 1 minute.
 The
     updated process makes the chamber easier and safer to handle.
 As a
     result, the testing cycle time has been improved by up to 45 minutes.
 Previously,
     only 5 testing cycles could be completed in a single shift, but now, with
     this improvement, 6 testing cycles can be completed in the same amount of
     time.


Key Benefits:

Significant
     reduction in time spent on each testing cycle.
 Increased
     productivity: one additional testing cycle per shift.
 Improved
     safety and ease of handling during chamber sealing.
 Reduced
     consumption of fasteners, contributing to cost savings.",Darwin, Anand Tiwari (anand_tiwari@raychemrpg.com),Raychem RPG,Yes,,No,"The initial integration of the new closing clamp device into

auction for Services negotiations. Oracle Fusion reverse auction module is used
for first time for services Cost negotiation. This process innovation involved
the Cost negotiation of ARC of Jointing & Termination Jobs A/c -AEML,
Mumbai - Services. 

The primary purpose of Indirect Services negotiations
through Reverse Auction is to get maximum cost negotiation through online
platform.This helps organizations to stop manual negotiations of the services
and proceed with reverse auction. The primary objectives were to get maximum
cost saving, reduce lead time and turn around time, improve efficiency through reverse
auction of services through Oracle system.

Prospective bidders are registered in oracle system
and RFQ is shared to Four suppliers. We have received quotation from four
suppliers and reverse auction is done with them. Post Reverse Auction, Post
Auction post auction bidding is done with suppliers and final negotiations are
done. As per lowest prices received from supplier prices of other suppliers are
also standardized.

An Independent Project Risk Management Cell
(IPRMC) shall be developed to identify, access, manage and mitigating risks
associated with projects throughout the life cycle, from bid to closure stage,
to safeguard the project profitability. 

 

The Project Risk Management Cell
must be allowed to work independently so that it can provide the risks inputs
to the management without any prejudice. 

 

Necessity: Margin erosion is the most common
issue associated with the project owing to various internal and external
factors which bounds to ponder over the necessity for the development of an
Independent Project Risk Management Cell (IPRMC). It is required to strengthen
the existing process to cater such requirement in the organization. 

 

IPRMC Team Members: Apart from the general expertise in
their respective domain, a must trait of the team members of the Independent
Project Risk Management Cell (IPRMC) should be critical thinking and candid
approach in tabling their views and ideas without any influence.

 

IPRMC Structure: 

Chairman:  Responsible for entire risk management process, coordination with SMEs
and effective implementation of risk strategies. Additionally, mentoring the region-based
Risk Management Groups (RMG) which will be formed for developing the second
line.  

 

Subject Matter Experts (SMEs): The Cell will comprise form experts
of Contract Management, Engineering, Legal, Commercial/ Finance & Taxation,
Logistic, Execution etc. 

 

Working Methodology: The Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)
will first provide their independent views for the prospective / under
execution projects to the chairman of the IPRMC for further joint brainstorming
and finalizing the Risk Mitigation / Exploitation Plan (for positive risk). 

 

Key Advantages:  

a.       Proactive Risk Management

b.       More candid feedback for bid
participation decision 

c.       Safeguard of projected Project
Profitability with improved Project Deliverables 

d.       Resource optimization

e.       Customer Satisfaction

The
main challenge in the formation of the Independent Project Risk Management Cell
is the sense of complacency of having such system.

pad precisely in the center for each cycle, ensuring uniformity and consistency
in the final product. However, when the application is consistently off-center,
the operator must manually adjust the centering before each cycle. This
additional manual intervention not only increases the operator’s workload but
also leads to potential delays and inconsistencies, reducing overall
productivity. Furthermore, the need for manual adjustments introduces a risk of
human error, which could further affect the quality of the output. To address

The "" Indirect Purchase of Engineering
and Admin through Direct catalogue buying from Amazon Corporate account.
Corporate Account with Amazon project at` Raychem RPG represents a breaking
initiative within the Darwin category, focused on Efficiency improvement and
simplification in procurement of products through online procurement through
Amazon corporate site. This process innovation involved the change of process
of Indirect Purchase from Third party dealers to direct procurement from Amazon
Site.

The primary purpose of Indirect
material through Amazon Catalogue buying is by booking orders directly. This
helps organizations to stop procurement through third party aggregators and purchase
directly through Amazon Corporate account through Amazon Cart. The primary
objectives were to reduce lead time and better visibility of the products with
user because of Images and contracted rate, Seamless process through Catalogue
buying.

In Amazon Corporate buying process,
Company account is created with individual login to user department. User
Department will login on Amazon corporate portal and order material from
products available on Amazon site. Simultaneously User Department will give
either open PR or PR as per requirement raised. Amazon will deliver material as
per confirmation of schedule ship date. 

In the past the procurement of
items available on Amazon site is done by raising purchase orders to Third
party dealer or distributor who was buying from Amazon site. We were not able
to buy directly. Now Amazon corporate account is created, and procurement is
started directly.

At present, we bid projects of Government and win projects
through competitive bidding. However the project idea we bid for is not our, is
of the Government agency. What if we build an idea, present it to the National
Capital Region Planning Board under unsolicited proposals (Under Swiss
Challenge method) and then provide our offer of execution of the work. We also
shall have the right to accept the price of L1 bidder for our idea project.
Current project innovation can be River Rejuvenation Project for Water business
unit under CIVIL SBU and Mordernalization of Railway Station





Such similar guidelines are available for bidding of project
through innovation as unsolicited proposals. This method is also called as
Swiss challenge method. 





Worldwide, many projects have been taken up for execution for
unsolicited proposals having the incentives given to the 1st proposal by
Swiss Challenge method, bonus mechanism, or automatic shortlisting method of
tendering. The Swiss challenge method provides the right to match to the
winning bidder’s price to the original unsolicited proposer. There are several
advantages of this method of bidding, as it brings out innovation-based
projects from private sector, faster execution and at times helps raise finance
for the project. So
far, there are 9 State Governments that have formed the Guidelines for
Unsolicited proposals and have used the method of the Swiss challenge. Some exciting
projects have already  been constructed in India with the Swiss challenge method.We can explore similar innovative project opportunities through Swiss Challenge method of execution.   Initially, we need to finalize the idea on which tendering can be done. I propose the following ideas to be worked upon. 1. Chennai River Rejuvenation Project (Adyar River). Every year this river gets flooded and the Chennai public is left to floods at least for 2 -5 days. The main reason being the blockages of Adyar river. The city also looses it's charm as this river is mostly converted into a Nalla and is used for discharge of the industrial waste. We may propose a river rejuvenation project which ensure that the stream is only filled by clean water as we shall deploy 3 - 5Nos of 20 -40 MLD Sewerage treatment plant capturing the sewage water being disposed to the Adyar river. Treated water from the STPs shall be then discharged into the Adyar river, making it a river of fresh water, which would be suitable for marine animals life. Along with the beautiful cross section of the river, on the high banks we can create recreational parks and cycle tracks for the entire city. Such effort is already made in Jaipur for Dravyavati river rejuvenation project. 2. Modernization of Indian Railway Station : Government of India has taken initiatives to modernize the Railway Station. Railways have taken up ABC and Kavach projects under GatiShakti scheme, which will increase the speed of the Railway network. This also means that the footfall at the stations shall increase. However, most of the Indian Railway stations are not up the International standards, nor they are built to carry large footfall expected in the next 10 - 15 years. With Swiss challenge method we can propose to modernize certain very important Railway stations of India in a unique way that they become benchmarks of minimum standards required at a station today. This includes making a Railway station accessible through face ID, upgraded grade escalated and foot over bridges with lift and escalator, better facilities for rest and boarding and deboarding at each platform. In short we can propose to make Railway stations up to standards of Airports and beyond. ",Kahuna,,KEC,Yes,,No,Tendering effort is required to take such initiatives. 1.

siloed development and lack of cross-enterprise collaboration often lead to
inefficiencies, redundant efforts, and missed opportunities for innovation.

 Different companies within the group may
independently solve similar problems without leveraging existing solutions or
expertise, preventing the full potential of cross-enterprise synergies,
limiting innovation and scalability 

 

To address this
challenge, we propose the implementation of an Inner Source Working Model
across RPG Group companies. Inner Source leverages the principles of
open-source development within the organization to create a shared culture of
collaboration and innovation. 

 

The solution includes
creating a centralized repository platform, establishing clear contribution
guidelines, and designating roles like project owners, contributors, and
community managers to maintain quality and foster collaboration with like
minded group of SME’s.  By establishing a
central platform for code, tools, and knowledge sharing, this model enables
developers and teams from various enterprises to contribute to and benefit from
reusable assets like APIs, frameworks, libraries, and best practices.

 

 

We possess a unique blend of domain
expertise, product engineering capabilities, and software development
proficiency, spanning industries like manufacturing, infrastructure, and IT
services.  By bringing these strengths
together under an Inner Source framework, we can drive joint innovation,
fostering collaboration across companies and unlocking synergies. 

 

For example, leveraging CEAT's tire domain
expertise with Zensar's AI capabilities could result in predictive maintenance
solutions. 

Similarly, KEC’s infrastructure knowledge
combined with digital twins can enhance project efficiencies. 

Innovations could include image
processing for defect detection, generative AI solutions for design
optimization, IoT-driven predictive analytics, AI-powered supply
chain resilience tools, and digital platforms for workforce productivity
enhancements. Inner Source ensures these collaborations are seamless,
transparent, and repeatable, creating a culture of shared success.",Kahuna, Gayathri N V S (gayathri.nvs@zensar.com),Zensar Technologies,Yes,,Yes,- Resistance to accept newer ways of working- Existing operational constraints- Coming up with right rewards and recognition framework - Engagement and partnership - Challenges in defining boundaries for sensitive information and intellectual property.,,"Qualitative Impact:{Qualitative Impact,Internal},{Remarks,<div class=""flex max-w-full flex-col flex-grow""><div dir=""auto"" class=""min-h-8 text-message flex w-full flex-col items-end gap-2 whitespace-normal break-words [.text-message+&amp;]:mt-5""><div class=""flex w-full flex-col gap-1 empty:hidden first:pt-[3px]""><div class=""markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light""><ul><li><p>Increase in the number of new features or solutions developed per year, driven by cross-enterprise collaboration, potentially growing innovation output by 25-30%.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><div class=""mb-2 flex gap-3 empty:hidden -ml-2""><div class=""items-center justify-start rounded-xl p-1 flex""><div class=""flex items-center""><span class=""""><span class=""flex h-[30px] w-[30px] items-center justify-center""></span></span><span class=""""><span class=""flex h-[30px] w-[30px] items-center justify-center""></span></span><div class=""flex""><span class=""""><span class=""flex h-[30px] w-[30px] items-center justify-center""></span></span><span class=""""><span cla}","Realised so far:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}","Projected Annually:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}",Yes,41,

significant challenge for Raychem RPG, as compliance is mandatory for importing
such materials. Initially, we believed that Raychem RPG had to obtain this

responsibility for certification actually lies with the supplier.

 

Our existing EVA material suppliers, DOW and Repsol, were
unable to pursue BIS certification due to the low volume of EVA material
consumption in India and the high associated certification costs. This prompted
us to explore alternative solutions.

 

After conducting thorough research on BIS certifications, we
found that the organization also certifies various global suppliers. Using this
information, we devised an innovative solution: sourcing EVA materials from
SIPCHEM, a BIS-certified supplier located in Saudi Arabia. This strategy not

Statement: 

While
working on the Affinity Insurance web portal, we observed that users
are required to log in separately with different credentials across
multiple tabs for managing various clients. This process is not only
cumbersome but also frustrating for users, particularly those
handling multiple clients simultaneously. This inefficiency in
workflow prompted us to brainstorm a solution to streamline and
simplify the user experience. 



We
observed that any updates to data or business rules require the
client to rely on the technical team, leading to delays and
inefficiencies in implementing changes. This dependency slows down
the process, impacting agility and operational effectiveness.

Factor?

Power factor (PF)
is a measure of how efficiently an electrical system converts power into
useful work output. It's the ratio of the real power (kW) to the apparent
power (kVA) consumed by an electrical system. 

How can I improve
my Power Factor?

a. If power factor is on the lagging side it can be
improved by installing

capacitors of
appropriate ratings and if the power factor is on leading side it can be
improved by installing reactors/ removing excess capacitors of appropriate
ratings.

Problems

Ø  The 
Capacitor  to be switch ON/OFF
manually depend upon load.

Ø  A low power factor can increase your electricity
bill .

Ø  A low power factor means that more power is being
wasted. For example, a power factor of 0.7 means that 70% of power is
being used effectively and 30% is being wasted.

Ø  A low power factor increases the amount of current
flowing through your electrical system, which can cause voltage drops.

Ø  A low power factor means that the measured amount of
KVA is higher than the demand for KW.

Benefits 

Ø  The  capacitor
are switching are  done  On/Off automatically depend upon load.

Ø  Power factor improvement means minimizing drawl of
reactive power from power system so as to make power factor unity. It is
nothing but providing adequate compensation so that the reactive power
requirement of the load is locally fulfilled instead of drawing it from the
power system.

Ø  Power Factor correction has lower electric bills and
demand charges.

Ø  It has  reduce
your power consumption, which can lead to a reduced carbon footprint and fewer
greenhouse gas emissions

·      
Challenge: Data quality and integrity of data was the biggest challenge since
data is sources from different systems

·      
Solution: Designed robust data mapping and developed in-house data validation
rules to ensure no gaps or errors in different type of data. Also implemented
data certification process to ensure client only access validated and certified
data

2. Cost of Analytics Tools

·      
Challenge: As the number of users grew, licensing cost for Tableau also
increased significantly

·      
Solution: Replaced Tableau with D3JS but that resulted in increased
development time, which led to use of AMCharts which are simpler and follow
low-code approaches

3. Data Residency Compliance

·      
Challenge: Clients belong to some specific countries had restrictions on
where their data can be stored. For example, A high value Canadian client did
not want their data to be stored in US or Australia, which were our main and DR
location

·      
Solution: Implemented MongoDB ATLAS Geo-Sharding capabilities, which allowed
us to store the data in Ireland and DR in UK. 

4. Re-usability and Scalability

·      
Challenge: As the number of modules and API grew, it was difficult to serve
global clients from a single cloud deployment. Other applications and products
showed interest to use some of Insure360 modules and API in their applications.


·      
Solution: To address scalability, we deployed application on AWS CloudFront,
which improved the performance of the application. Re-usability was achieved by
deploying UI modules as MicroFrontend where each module could be integrated and
deployed on its own.

7. Security and Access Control

streamlined access by incorporating addresses of the head office, sales
offices, and plant locations into the bot.

Roadshow Success and User Engagement: To spread
awareness and gather valuable feedback, we conducted 11 comprehensive roadshows
at the plant location and head office covering 250+ employees. These roadshows
covered Raybot, Percipio, and OneRPG, significantly boosting user engagement.
Post-roadshows, 521 out of 599 users are now active on Raybot, marking a
remarkable 331% increase in interactions, achieving a total of 11,935 interactions
by November 2024.

Grievance Module Impact: The rollout of the
grievance module has been highly effective. In just two months, we resolved 154
issues, with 11 issues acknowledged and 3 as open. This helped in addressing user concerns promptly and efficiently.

User Preferences and Interaction Channels: The
payroll documents feature has emerged as the most used, and the mobile app is
the preferred channel of interaction for our users, highlighting the
convenience and accessibility of our solutions.

Statement

Instant Payment is globally adopted by most regional regulators
due to the key benefit of immediate fund movement between parties. Corporates also
prefer Instant payment to support their business as the money can be instantly
settled. 

Globally, there are many instant payment schemes are designed and
launched by payment scheme providers & regulators. The growth rate of the adoption
of the usage of Instant payments was very high which results in payment
industry looking for introducing instant payments across regions from domestic widely
used today.

At present most of these payment schemes are either api driven or file
driven. The file definitions and standards are well defined by the regulator
and FI’s adopting these schemes must undergo implementation of these file
exchange standards and adhere to regulatory timelines and certifications. FI’s
are struggling a lot to develop these file standards and enhance their existing
application to build and maintain. 

The below are some of the factors for FI,

·        
Complete
the implementation within the provided minimal time window.

·        
Larger
manpower to develop, test & maintenance.

·        
New
changes Impact their existing applications to be managed.

·        
Frequent
upgrades from schemes make to reiterate the whole process. 

·        
FI’s
are placed in a situation to spend more to upgrade their applications to higher
versions/latest technologies to adopt instant payments.

 

Solution:

Banks must focus on some easier, efficient & less impact model
to overcome the above-mentioned pain points. 

Our idea is to leverage Generative AI capability to build a robust
tool/framework that support to generate the Instant payment required api / file
based on the data feed provided.

FI’s can send the required information to the tool as per the file
specification provided (Simple, easy mapping from Data Base) either through
SFTP or as a file upload. The tool to generate the target scheme specific api /
file specified and place the file in the payment gateway. 

The response from the payment gateway to be debulked and provided to
FI as a file in the bank specified format. 

There will be an UI to provide insights on the files submitted for
processing and files received as response.

The tool will have to be built with a strong user management
profile so that clear audit log maintained for the tool access and file
exchange logs.     

The tool will not store the file and will transform and send the file.

Reports to be generated with the real time processing status.

This framework underlying this innovative solution is extendable
and can be used across multiple payment schemes.

However, this approach becomes less economical when restoring roads (CC/Bitumen roads), which is often the case during distribution work in the narrow streets of villages and cities. In these situations, Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD) is more economical and convenient. Nonetheless, HDD has a limitation: the straightness of the drilling path cannot be guaranteed. As a result, there are instances where the exit pipe ends up in undesirable locations, such as inside houses. This often leaves us with no choice but to revert to the open cut method, which has its own drawbacks, including being inconvenient, time-consuming, and costly. Additionally, laying pipes using HDD makes it challenging to trace the pipeline's path. This requires digging at multiple locations to track the underground pipes.At Satna, we addressed the limitations of HDD by integrating metal detection technology with the drilling process. This approach has led to significant savings of Rs 2.5 crore by laying 100 km of HDPE pipe through HDD.

tap aerator is a small device that fits onto the end of a tap. It mixes air
with the water flow, reducing the volume of water coming out without
compromising pressure. This helps save water and enhances the tap’s overall
performance.When water passes through the aerator, it
divides into numerous tiny streams, mixing with air. This creates a consistent
and efficient water flow that uses less water without losing pressure. Using
tap aerators saves water, helping households and businesses cut down on usage
and reduce their bills. Furthermore, they support global water conservation
efforts, making them a simple yet effective tool for sustainability.Water saving aerator reduces the flow
rate of water by 70-80 per cent. For instance, if the flow rate is 10 litres
per minute (LPM), aerator brings it down to 3 LPM without any compromise on
washing experience. This way, 80 per cent of the water is saved.Made of silicon based
plastic, water saving aerators last for three to four years and need cleaning
once in six months. It can cost as low as Rs. 150. The price of the product
goes up to Rs. 450, depending on the size and the type of the product wish to
buy.Many
benefits of conserving water at work:•Foam/Bubble flow•Saves water, reduces water bill;
helps to go green•It helps your business meet

This rigidity results in predictable interactions, static relationships, and repetitive gameplay experiences that fail to fully immerse players. Furthermore, current game design struggles to provide personalized storylines that evolve uniquely for each player, leaving untapped potential for deeper engagement and replayability. There is a critical need for an innovative approach to NPC behavior and storytelling that allows for greater responsiveness, autonomy, and narrative flexibility to create richer, more immersive gaming experiences.Solution:Generative AI addresses the limitations of traditional NPCs by enabling unprecedented levels of responsiveness, adaptability, and autonomy. With this technology, NPCs can dynamically react to their environment and players’ actions, pursue independent goals, and develop evolving relationships with players over time. Generative AI also facilitates the creation of personalized storylines, allowing each player’s narrative to unfold uniquely based on their choices and interactions.Impact:This innovation enhances immersion by creating one-of-a-kind, deeply engaging gaming experiences tailored to individual players. It transforms static and predictable gameplay into dynamic, evolving narratives, fundamentally reshaping storytelling and game mechanics. Generative AI-powered NPCs not only elevate player engagement and satisfaction but also open new possibilities for game design, paving the way for a more personalized and interactive gaming future.",Greenball,,Zensar Technologies,Yes,,Yes,,,"Qualitative Impact:{Qualitative Impact,External}","Realised so far:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}","Projected Annually:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}",Yes,96,

Automation & DigitalizationIn enhancing Calibration Automation and Digitalization
through Kaizen, a logical approach involves identifying current inefficiencies,
such as untimely calibrations and missing reports. Analyzing root causes, including manual processes and a lack
of digital systems, drives the need for change. Implementing a centralized,
automated system for scheduling, tracking, and generating reports emerges as a
logical solution. Education programs to raise awareness about the benefits of
digitalization ensure stakeholder buy-in. This systematic approach aligns with
Kaizen principles, fostering continuous improvement in calibration processes,
reducing errors, improving efficiency, and aligning with organizational goals
for enhanced precision and compliance. CountermeasureGetting an automatic notification prior to expiration or due

However, the setup resulted in a significant line balancing issue. This imbalance between the production stages caused inefficiencies, leading to a huge backlog in production, affecting overall throughput and increasing lead times.To resolve these issues, we decided to develop a new manual expansion machine equipped with 10 stations. The key improvements are:Increased Station Capacity: With 10 stations, the new machine is better equipped to handle the 16-cavity mold, ensuring that the workload is more evenly distributed across the stations.Line Balancing Resolution: The 10-station machine provides better balance and alignment with the output of the mold, allowing each station to work at optimal capacity without causing delays or backlogs. This adjustment greatly improved the flow of production and reduced wait times between stages.Manual Operation: By opting for a manual system, we were able to retain flexibility and control over the expansion process, allowing for faster adjustments and maintenance when needed.Results and Benefits:Cost Savings: The new manual 10-station expansion machine resulted in a significant cost saving of approximately 5.5 lakhs compared to the earlier machine setup. The reduction in investment allowed us to allocate resources more efficiently without compromising production quality or capacity.Increased Efficiency: With the line balancing issues resolved, production efficiency improved, and the backlog was significantly reduced. This allowed the production line to meet the required output and delivery deadlines more effectively.Improved Production Flow: The smoother, balanced operation of the new machine meant that production became more streamlined, with fewer delays and greater overall throughput.",Darwin,,Raychem RPG,Yes,,No,,,"Qualitative Impact:{Qualitative Impact,External}","Realised so far:{Unit,INR},{Amount,550000},{Type,Cost Saving}","Projected Annually:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}",Yes,128,

To migrate legacy mainframe applications to a modern, scalable, and
efficient microservices-based architecture using GenAI for reverse and forward
engineering.

Challenges:

1.     Complexity of
Legacy Systems: Mainframe applications are often written in outdated languages and
have complex interdependencies.

2.     Manual Effort: Traditional
migration methods are labour-intensive and time-consuming.

3.     Cost and Time: High costs
and extended timelines associated with manual code analysis and rewriting.

Solution:

1.     Assessment and
Planning:

·        
Evaluate the existing mainframe applications: Identify the
components, dependencies, and data flows.

·        
Define the target architecture: Plan how the
microservices will be structured and how they will interact.

·        
Create a migration roadmap: Outline the
phases of migration, including timelines and resource allocation.

2.     Reverse Engineering
with GenAI:

·        
Automated Code Analysis: Use GenAI to
analyze and understand the existing mainframe codebase.

·        
Business Requirements Extraction: Automatically
extract business logic and requirements from the legacy code.

·        
Documentation: Generate comprehensive
documentation to aid in the forward engineering process.

3.     Forward Engineering
with GenAI:

·        
Microservices Design: Design a
microservices-based architecture using modern technologies like Java/Spring
Boot.

·        
Code Generation: Utilize GenAI to generate new
code based on the extracted business logic and requirements.

·        
Template Design Patterns: Implement
template design patterns to ensure consistency and accelerate development.4.    Data Migration:
 
  Data
      Extraction and Transformation: Migrate data from mainframe databases to
      modern databases, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
  Integration
      with Modern Systems: Ensure seamless data flow between new
      microservices and existing systems.

is Tailstock
in Tyre
Building
Machine?
Tyre
Building machine produces Carcass, which is 1st of Tyre building machine. This consists
of Head stock and Tailstock units. Tailstock is used to apply Beads of the
Carcass in tyre building process.
Problem Statement
In
tyre building process, Tailstock is applied twice in one cycle of carcass. Its
applied manually by pushing and pulling the tailstock unit by the associates in
every cycle. This pushing/pulling of tailstock unit creates high fatigue and
MURI to the associates resulting in lower Morale in associates.1. High associate MURI while pulling and pushing the tailstock for  application of  bead and Chaffer on carcass.2.Increase in Cycle time due to this manual operation

Why need a
immediate solution?
Our
team took it seriously and start finding
 the solution for this. we created so many
concepts considering Safety, Feasibility and Easy of Operations.
After multiple PDCA we come out with an unique solution. We developed a Sector gear mechanism which
can operate the tailstock automatically.

Solution:
We have developed a customised drive mechanism suitable for tailstock without
affecting the process and safety of the associate. An
motorised sector gear unit has been introduced at the bottom of the tailstock
and by a click of button, the tailstock will automatically move and take its
position for the next operation. This has eliminated the Fatigue and MURI of
the associates.

checked with insurance company data and survey fees charged by insurance
company are brought to notice of insurance team and if premium loading is found to increase as a result of survey fees, the same is reduced by our team through mutual discussion with insurance company and thus the premium loading is reduced by bringing it
in the lower loading bracket

 

Risk and loss minimization measures

By making project team aware about risk minimization
measures, the project team is made aware of insurance policy terms and
conditions and as a result they are better equipped with better understanding of
insurance coverage terms and thus minimize losses and address the claim in line with the terms and conditions of the insurance policy

 

Examples

During incidence of Michaung cyclone, a detailed communication was sent across to all project teams by suggesting appropriate measures/action in the event of loss occurrence. Thus, project teams were made aware about the risks and actions to be taken in the event of a claim and also were made aware of the insurance policy terms and conditions thus project team was better equipped to handle the queries of insurance surveyor.

     the adequacy of packing prior to shifting
 If
     packing is already weak and lost its integrity, lifting the pallet with
     fork in such a condition will result in the lifting fork breaking into the
     packaging and damaging the modules 
 If
     required, repackaging with a stronger and healthier packing to prevent
     lifting fork from breaking into the packaging and resulting in further
     damages to modules 
 Approach
     roads wherever required to level the ground unevenness and to minimize

The system will process the document, extract its content, vectorize it into embeddings, and store the embeddings in PostgreSQL. Users can then query the system, which will retrieve and generate relevant responses based on semantic search and question-answering techniques.Problem in Details :Managing and retrieving information from documents is a significant challenge for individuals and organizations. Traditional document management systems rely on basic keyword searches, which are inefficient when dealing with large datasets or complex queries. These systems struggle to handle:Searching both document metadata and content with precision.Answering specific, context-driven questions based on document content.Providing relevant results efficiently, leading to wasted time and productivity loss.Our Solution:We propose a system that allows users to upload documents via a UI, vectorize the content and metadata, store this information in PostgreSQL, and enable powerful question-and-answer capabilities using these vectors. This solution leverages advanced AI models for vectorization and semantic search.System Components and Workflow : 1. File Upload UI:Build a user-friendly interface where users can upload documents (PDF, DOCX, etc.).2. Backend Service: File Processing: Extract content and metadata from uploaded documents.Vectorization: Use an AI model (like OpenAI) to generate embeddings for the content and metadata.Database Storage: Store the embeddings, content, and metadata in a PostgreSQL database.3. Search and Query Interface:  Query Input: Allow users to input queries or questions.Hybrid Search: Combine full-text and vector search to find the most relevant documents.Response Generation: Provide users with relevant document excerpts or answers based on their queries.4. Technical Implementation               1. File Upload UI:          Use a framework like React or Angular for the frontend.          Implement file upload functionality with progress indicators and error handling.              2. Backend Service:          File Processing: Use libraries like PyPDF2 for PDF and python-docx for DOCX.          Vectorization: Use OpenAI’s text-embedding models for generating embeddings.          Database: PostgreSQL with extensions for handling vector data.      3. Search and Query Interface:          Implement search functionality using a combination of SQL for metadata and vector-based                         queries for content.",NeoStar,,Zensar Technologies,Yes,,Yes,"Challenges1.

Potential Cost Saving  : Rs. 65- Rs. 39 = Rs. 26 X 22,46,664 = Rs. 5.84
CrAs margin improved in IPC 25-70, The Raychem's LVABC Engineering team has also started the horizontal deployment of such design improvement in all IPC family which will create a stronghold position in LVABC segment.

 ",NeoStar,,Raychem RPG,Yes,,No,"1)  Margin Improvement: As this
is the VELOCITY project, management’s clear ask is to achieve break even margin
against the existing -Ve margin. The Challenge was taken by the LVABC team and
achieved 21.7% positive margin.

 

2)  Customer specific requirement: RDSS has a
specific requirement of additional body strength requirement of 1.5 times of
torque value, whereas regular IPC is supplied with 1.2 times torque value. The
same was achieved by doing detailed engineering and improving the lower and
upper body strength along with providing metal hardware.

 

3)   Weight, Cost and Components reduction
was achieved by doing DOE (Design of experiments) and DOA (Design of Assembly) along
with simulation of body and blade.

 

·      
Shaer head length is reduced to sufficient
level to achieve required performance.

·      
New Shear head is developed in Naylon in place
of Metal shear head which is cost effective

·    Length of piercing blade is optimized which
ultimately results in reduction of upper body, lower body and hardware

 

4)     
Stringent High voltage requirement: Material
and weight reduction was achieved in the new IPC 25-70 which was creating
leakage issues of water during 6kV High voltage test. Insulation rubber design
was Improved to achieve Isolation of blade from any water ingress which now can
be capable to withstand test at 8kV.

 

5)    Critical Verification and Validation: All required
Type Testing and Internal routine testing performed along with 1000 Nos. of
Electrical ageing Test. Newly developed IPC 25-70 successfully cleared all Type
Test.",Innovation Festival- Margin improvement of VELOCITY RDSS Project -Cost Optimization of IPC 25-70.pdf^Innovation Festival- Margin improvement of VELOCITY RDSS Project -Cost Optimization of IPC 25-70.pdf,"Qualitative Impact:{Qualitative Impact,External},{Remarks,<p><b>External Customers (End Users)</b></p><p>1. <b>Performance Reliability:</b> Ensures the IPC 25-70&#160; meets strength and durability expectations.</p><p>2. <b>Cost-Effectiveness</b>: Offers an affordable, lightweight, and competitive solution.</p><p>3. <b>Ease of Installation</b>: Simplifies installation, saving time and labor costs.</p><p>4. <b>Compliance and Safety</b>: Meets standards, ensuring safety and reducing risks.</p><p>5. <b>Enhanced Reputation</b>: Builds trust, encouraging repeat purchases and referrals.</p><p>6. <b>Customer Retention and Growth</b>: Increases satisfaction and loyalty for long-term relationships.</p><p><br></p><p></p><p><u><b>Internal Customers (Within the Organization)</b></u></p><p>1. <b>Performance Reliability:</b> Showcases the team&#8217;s ability to deliver reliable products.</p><p>2. <b>Cost-Effectiveness</b>: Reduces production costs, saving &#8377;26 per unit.</p><p>3. <b>Learning and expertise development</b> by taking head on challenge</p}","Realised so far:{Unit,INR},{Amount,0}","Projected Annually:{Unit,INR},{Amount,58400000},{Type,Cost Saving}",Yes,55,

a)	Project margins are determined at the time of bid preparation therefore responsibilities to be assigned at this stage for ensuring timely completion and margin retention.
b)	BU head being the project owner should be the final authority for bid finalisation and ultimately responsible for scheduled completion within budget.
c)	A committee maybe constituted (preferably comprising BD representatives from all verticals for better synergy) to take decision on going ahead with a project.
d)	Decision to bid should follow with a kick-off meeting where bidding team with responsibility allocation is formulated along with identification of Bid manager.
e)	Bidding team should comprise of the Bid manager and representatives from Estimation and Procurement and Commercial/taxation departments duly supported by the BD team.
f)	Bid manager (who is ultimately be deputed to project) will finalise the work breakdown, execution sequence, resource planning and deployment.
g)	Estimation team will finalise quantities taking input from design teams both internal and external
h)	Inputs on supply chain management, equipment/ shuttering hiring charges , import duty, C&F, direct and indirect taxation to be provided by Procurement and Commercial department, respectively.
i)	Bid submission to be responsibility of Estimation/ BD team.

Deployment of specialist foundation teams immediately upon project award ensuring process improvement and timely completion:

a)	Timely execution is key for preventing erosion of margin. 
b)	There is generally a gap of at least 3 months between project award and site mobilization on account of reallocating resources from other operational sites.
c)	It is recommended to carve out a department/BU specialising in site clearance, soil stabilization and sub-structure/ foundation construction for deployment in projects across BUs
d)	This dept/BU comprising specialist teams (comprising of experienced foreman/chargehands and an engineer for guidance) will provide cost effective methodology and shall be pressed into operation immediately upon project award.
e)	Superstructure/ projects team can mobilise subsequently to ensure proper sequencing of project activities.
f)	Timeline slippages occur mostly due to variations at founding levels, a dedicated team will ensure process improvement ensuring adherence to project timelines. 


Diversification:

a)	Strong balance sheet of KEC should be leveraged to enter Developer role through PPP, preferably Hybrid Annuity (HAM) route
b)	In HAM, 40% of the project cost is paid upfront by the authority during construction and balance project cost along with interest cost is released in the form of semi annuities over the balance concession period. O&M is paid separately, and most clients allow complete exit post project completion/operation (COD).
c)	Development margins shall be in addition to EPC margins from operations across verticals like solar, wind, green hydrogen, ropeways, warehousing, railways etc
d)	Developer role will also help KEC expand in foreign geographies undertaking projects of BOT, BOOT,EPC+F etc models synergising the strength of its verticals especially in the solar and wind sectors which include transmission line, subs-station and bay construction and electrification.
e)	KEC could also foray into the highway/expressway concession sector on PPP.

Other Points:

a)	A minimum inventory of shuttering/staging materials and equipment which have repetitive usage should be procured and stored across regional depots to be deployed across projects 
b)	For projects having concrete quantities more than 50,000 cum, company batching plant should compulsorily be setup to improve margins on account of material saving.
c)	Improve communication and coordination within and across verticals with both way communication across levels.
d)	Improvement in process digitalization using AI tools/IOT and applications like BIM, ERP etc.
e)	Strengthen central Contract department which through site QS team to monitor and create communication/documentation to secure approval for variations and EOT and future claims/ arbitrations.
f)	Formulation of job description and Skill mapping to be prioritised.",Greenball,,KEC,Yes,,No,,,"Qualitative Impact:{Qualitative Impact,External}","Realised so far:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}","Projected Annually:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}",Yes,4,

monolithic system with a server-side component implemented using Windows
Communication Foundation (WCF) services and a front end built with Windows
Forms. To enhance and modernize the application, we are transitioning to a .NET
8 API-based backend and using CRM and PowerApps for the front end. This
transformation aims to decouple the business logic from the front end, allowing
for greater flexibility and scalability.

As part of this enhancement, we are leveraging NuGet packages to
encapsulate common logic and functionalities. These packages include Database
Context, Common Classes and Interfaces, Utility Functions, and Transaction
Processor. The creation of these NuGet packages is automated through a DevOps
pipeline, which publishes the artifacts to Azure. These packages can then be
consumed by the API projects, ensuring consistency and ease of integration.

NuGet Packages:

1. Database Context:

· Manages
database connections and operations.· Provides
a consistent way to interact with the database across different microservices.· Ensures
efficient and secure data access.





2. Common Classes and Interfaces:

· Contains
shared data structures and contracts used across various services.· Promotes
code reuse and consistency.· Simplifies
the development process by providing a standard set of classes and interfaces.





3. Utility Functions:

· Includes
helper methods and utilities that are commonly used across different services.· Provides
functionalities such as logging, error handling, and configuration management.· Enhances
code maintainability and reduces redundancy.





4. Transaction Processor:

· Handles
the processing of accounting, ledger, and charges-related operations in the
banking system.· Manages
complex business transactions that span multiple services.· Ensures
consistency and reliability in transaction management, including commit and
rollback operations.· Updates
asccount balances and performs validation before executing any transactions on
accounts.

pipeline, which publishes the artifacts to Azure. This process ensures",Darwin, Bimalendu Rath (b.rath@zensar.com),Zensar Technologies,No, Vikas Kapoor (v.kapoor@zensar.com),Yes,"1.     
Monolithic Architecture:

·        
The tightly coupled nature of the monolithic application made testing
and maintenance difficult.

·        
All code being common resulted in challenges with isolating and testing
individual components.

2.     
Scalability and Flexibility:

·        
The existing architecture limited the ability to scale specific parts of
the application independently.

·        
Updating or changing the front-end technology was challenging due to its
tight coupling with the backend.

3.     
Maintenance:

·        
The monolithic structure made it hard to implement updates without
affecting the entire system.

·        
Common logic across different parts of the application led to
difficulties in managing dependencies and ensuring consistency.

4.     
Code Complexity:

·        
The existing codebase contains a lot of complexities, making it
difficult to understand and maintain.

·        
There is a significant amount of unused logic present in the code.

As part of the enhancement, we are retaining only the required logic,
rewriting the code in a more modern and efficient way.",,"Qualitative Impact:{Qualitative Impact,External},{Remarks,<div>Benefits:</div><div><ol><li>Modular Architecture</li><li>Improved Testing and Maintenance</li><li>Scalability and Flexibility</li><li>NuGet Packages</li><li>Code Simplification</li></ol></div><div>This enhancement project aims to future-proof the Activebank application, making it more adaptable to changing technologies and business needs.</div><div><br></div>}","Realised so far:{Unit,GBP},{Amount,12000},{Type,Cost Saving}","Projected Annually:{Unit,GBP},{Amount,}",Yes,59,

innovative motorcycle tire tread block
pattern designed for bias-ply tires,
specifically targeting the commuter motorcycle segment. The primary objective
of this design is to achieve high mileage, reaching up to 2X tire life, while improving wear characteristics,
stability, and handling. Key features of the invention include a carefully
engineered tread pattern that ensures uniform wear, promoting extended tire
life. The use of interlocked sipes enhances stability and handling by improving tangential stiffness,
while the integrated tie bar in the block design optimizes the wear in the center zone. The groove
design is optimized for effective water evacuation, minimizing hydroplaning and
improving wet traction. Additionally, an optimized
rubber ratio, with a higher concentration in
the center of the tire, enhances dry-road traction, reduces rolling resistance,
and contributes to better fuel efficiency. The optimized tread profile creates
a wider footprint, improving wear distribution. This tire design offers a well-balanced solution for improved durability, stability, and ride comfort, making it ideal for long-lasting and
cost-effective commuter motorcycle tires.

However, after implementing the shut-off pin, we have successfully reduced material leakage and minimized cycle time. As a result, the machine is now running more efficiently, with less waste and faster operation. These changes have led to improved overall performance and cost savings.",Darwin,,Raychem RPG,Yes,,Yes,"Integration and Compatibility:Ensuring the shut-off pin is fully compatible with the existing machine components and seamlessly integrates into the current system could be challenging. Any misalignment or incorrect installation could impact performance or cause malfunction.Initial Testing and Fine-Tuning:After installing the shut-off pin, thorough testing is required to ensure it functions as expected. Fine-tuning the settings for optimal performance might take time, and there could be unexpected issues during the initial stages of operation.Wear and Tear of the Shut-Off Pin:Over time, the shut-off pin may experience wear and tear due to continuous use, potentially causing it to become less effective. Regular maintenance or replacement of the pin could be necessary to ensure consistent performance.Training and Adaptation:Operators may need to be trained on how to effectively use and maintain the newly implemented shut-off pin system. This could lead to an initial learning curve and adaptation period to ensure the changes are utilized properly.Cost of Implementation:While the shut-off pin reduces material wastage and saves time in the long run, the initial cost of retrofitting the machine and implementing the solution could be a challenge, especially if unplanned expenses arise during the process.Reliability in Different Conditions:The shut-off pin needs to perform consistently under varying operational conditions, such as different temperatures, pressures, and material types. Ensuring its effectiveness across all production scenarios may require additional testing and adjustments.Potential for New Issues:While the shut-off pin addresses material leakage and cycle time, it could introduce new challenges, such as clogging or other malfunctions. Regular monitoring will be required to identify and address any new issues that might arise post-implementation.Downtime During Implementation:Implementing the shut-off pin may require machine downtime for installation and adjustment, which could temporarily affect production schedules. Ensuring minimal disruption to operations during this time will be important.Sustaining Long-Term Benefits:It's crucial to ensure that the improvements in material savings and cycle time reduction are sustained over the long term. Monitoring the machine's performance continuously to confirm that the gains are consistent will be important.Documentation and Standard Operating Procedures:Updating machine documentation and standard operating procedures (SOPs) to reflect the changes made for the shut-off pin implementation is necessary.

only imagined; Collaboration equals Innovation ”The MTSP Core team’s
collaborative efforts with Shell have led to the development of innovative
Power Automate RPA and AI  solutions, significantly reducing approximately
1500 hours of manual work per month. This initiative addresses the manual
voucher entry work at Shell, which occurs when the indoor point of sale (POS)
system cannot electronically record card information or transactions. In such
cases, Shell personnel manually create vouchers, a process that was previously
inefficient, time-consuming, error-prone, and unmonitored, involving
non-technical data entry using PDFs and spreadsheets.

 

Shell committed to automating
this manual work to save millions of dollars. Zensar partnered with Shell to
provide a value-added solution for voucher entry until a permanent solution was
found. Zensar proposed automating the manual voucher processing using the
Microsoft Power Platform , which Shell accepted. This automation saves Shell the
effort and cost equivalent to 8 members per
year, resulting in an annual saving of around 1 Crore.

 

The RPA/AI Power Automate tool
achieves 95% automation of manual vouchers, delivering significant benefits in
terms of productivity, transformation, and efficiency:

 


 -Manual data collection
     using spreadsheets
 -Excessive follow-ups via
     emails
 -Manual data validation
     causing accuracy issues
 -Difficulty in gaining

Converting PDFs to images page-by-page allows for a more uniform input format for advanced AI models like GPT-4.0, which can process visual data and extract meaningful content.Our Solution:Step 1: PDF Conversion to ImagesConvert each page of the PDF into high-resolution images (e.g., JPEG or PNG format).Tools like PYMPDF, PDF2IMAGE, or cloud-based APIs can handle this conversion.Step 2: Image Pre-processingEnhance image quality (e.g., noise reduction, contrast adjustment) to improve text readability.Identify regions of interest, such as text blocks, images, or tables, using computer vision techniques.Step 3: Content Extraction with GPT-4.oFeed the pre-processed images into a system combining GPT-4.0 and vision models (like OpenAI’s multi-modal capabilities).Perform the following: 
Extract text content.Interpret tables, charts, and handwritten elements.Retain formatting, structure, and context.Step 4: Post-processingUse GPT-4.0’s language understanding to: 
Correct OCR errors.Structure the extracted data into machine-readable formats (JSON, CSV, etc.).Reconstruct the document structure (e.g., headings, paragraphs, and tables).Step 5: Output GenerationSave the extracted content into formats like Word, Excel, or structured JSON for further analysis.Optionally, reassemble content into a searchable PDF with annotations.We have executed this process in one project and got good results.",Greenball,,Zensar Technologies,Yes,,Yes,"ChallengesImage Quality: Low-quality images or complex layouts may still pose challenges for accurate content extraction.Processing Time: Converting large PDFs into images and processing them can be resource-intensive.Accuracy with Complex Formats: Ensuring accurate extraction of tables, charts, or multi-language content requires advanced training and refinement.Integration: Combining the image processing and GPT-4.0 workflow seamlessly into existing document management systems.",,"Qualitative Impact:{Qualitative Impact,External},{Remarks,<span><p><b><b>Potential Impact</b></b></p><p><b><b><sub><br></sub></b></b></p><ul><li><sub><b><b>Improved Data Accessibility: Extract content from previously inaccessible PDF formats.</b></b></sub></li><li><sub><b><b>Enhanced Business Processes: Automate workflows in legal, finance, and other industries reliant on document digitization.</b></b></sub></li><li><sub><b><b>Innovation in OCR Technology: This approach pushes the boundaries of traditional OCR, offering a smarter</b>, <b>more flexible alternative.</b></b></sub></li></ul></span>}","Realised so far:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}","Projected Annually:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}",Yes,133,

By analyzing key PD parameters like inception voltage, magnitude, and fingerprint patterns, insulation weaknesses and discharge-related defects can be identified effectively.Contactless PD sensing techniques enable health assessment of Extra High Voltage (EHV) cable accessories, addressing PD as leading cause of electrical asset failures, responsible for 85% of substation issues. Standards IEC 60840 and IEC 62067 specify a maximum PD level of 10 pC, typically tested in factories using High-Frequency Current Transformers (HFCT). However, field assessments face challenges like noise interference.Advanced non-conventional sensors, integrated during joint or termination preparation of retrofitting on existing accessories, enable continuous online PD monitoring.

This lack of reference material makes it challenging to establish confidence in their performance across various cable systems and environments.2. High Cost Compared to Traditional Methods:Non-conventional PD sensing methods involve advanced technologies that significantly increase costs compared to traditional methods like High Voltage Frequency Transformer (HVFT) systems. This cost disparity can be a major barrier to adoption, particularly in cost-sensitive projects or applications.3. Validation Challenges:Unlike traditional HVFT systems, which directly measure PD levels in pC, non-conventional sensors often produce outputs in alternate units, such as vibration amplitudes or energy levels. Converting these outputs into a format comparable to pC values requires complex calibration and modeling, complicating the validation process.4. Determining Sensor Accuracy and Sensitivity:Establishing the required accuracy and sensitivity of the non-conventional sensor is a critical challenge. The sensor must reliably detect low PD levels (as small as 2 pC) while maintaining consistent performance under varying environmental conditions, such as noise and temperature fluctuations. Overly sensitive sensors risk false positives, while less accurate ones may fail to detect critical PD activity.5. Environmental and Operational Durability:Non-conventional PD sensors must perform reliably under demanding conditions, including high pressures and elevated temperatures encountered during joint and termination installations.

  Azathioprine, an immunosuppressive drug, is often synthesized
  through a series of chemical reactions in a manufacturing unit. One of the
  key intermediates in the production of azathioprine is Nitrazole, which plays
  a critical role in the process. Here's a simplified breakdown of how
  Nitrazole might be manufactured in a production unit: 2.
  
  
   
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
  
  Current Manufacturing :Nitrazole was manufactured in
  the MF1 plant, which produced sufficient stock for Azathioprine production.
  Commissioning of New Plant: A new plant (MF4) was
  planned for commissioning and manufacturing Nitrazole.
  Due to delays in commissioning the new plant, the existing stock
  of Nitrazole became insufficient for ongoing Azathioprine production.
  Impact on Azathioprine Delivery: The
  insufficient supply of Nitrazole caused delays in Azathioprine production and
  subsequent delivery.
  Temporary Mitigation: To address this shortfall,
  Nitrazole was manufactured at Manufacturing Unit 2 as an interim
  solution, ensuring that the required quantity of Nitrazole was available for
  Azathioprine production.

Inefficiency and Delays:


 Slow Approval Process: Work
     permits require physical signatures and manual review, which can result in
     delays, especially when key personnel are unavailable.
 Time-Consuming: Manually
     filling out, reviewing, and processing work permits takes more time than
     automated or online systems.


2. Human
Error:


 Mistakes in Documentation:
     Manual entry of data can lead to errors, such as missing information or
     incorrect details, which can compromise safety.
 Unreadable Handwriting: Poor
     handwriting or unclear documentation can make it difficult to understand
     work permits, increasing the risk of miscommunication.


3.
Limited Tracking and Monitoring:


 Difficult Track Status: It's
     hard to monitor the status of permits (approved, in progress, completed)
     without a centralized, real-time system.
 Loss of Documents: Paperwork
     can be lost, misplaced, or damaged, making it difficult to track
     historical records or audits.


4. Lack
of Standardization:


 Inconsistent Formats:
     Different departments or workers may use different formats for permits,
     leading to inconsistencies and confusion.
 Inconsistent Safety Checks:
     Manual checks may not always follow standard procedures, resulting in
     inadequate safety assessments.


5.
Environmental Impact:


 Paper Usage: Offline systems
     generate significant amounts of paper, contributing to waste and
     negatively impacting the environment.


Storage Issues: Storing
large volumes of paper documents can be cumbersome and requires physical space.1.

experiencing rapid technological advancements, with EV fleets emerging as a
cornerstone of future transportation systems. Generative AI (GenAI) presents a
significant opportunity to optimize fleet management, particularly in
predictive maintenance and performance optimization. By leveraging GenAI
models, fleet operators can proactively identify potential vehicle failures,
reducing downtime and improving operational efficiency. Furthermore, GenAI can
optimize routing, energy consumption, and charging station utilization,
enhancing overall fleet performance and customer satisfaction.",NeoStar,,Zensar Technologies,Yes,,Yes,"Predictive Maintenance Accuracy:

Current predictive maintenance systems rely
on basic data analytics to forecast potential vehicle failures. However, these
systems lack the sophistication to accurately predict failures before they
occur, resulting in unplanned downtime.

Existing predictive maintenance systems use
rudimentary data analytics to anticipate vehicle maintenance needs.
Unfortunately, these systems often fail to accurately predict failures in
advance, leading to unexpected downtime.

Data Overload:

The sheer volume of data generated by
electric vehicles, encompassing battery life, charging patterns, usage, and
environmental conditions, can be overwhelming. Current systems find it
difficult to extract meaningful insights from this vast data set.

Electric vehicles generate a massive amount
of data, including battery health, charging habits, usage patterns, and
environmental factors. Existing systems struggle to process and analyze this
data to derive actionable insights.

Route and Energy Optimization:

Fleet operators face significant challenges
in optimizing vehicle routes and managing energy consumption. Inefficient
planning can lead to extended travel times, increased operational costs, and
more frequent charging stops.

Optimizing vehicle routes and energy
consumption is a major challenge for fleet operators. Ineffective planning can
result in longer journey times, higher operational expenses, and more frequent
charging breaks.

Integration with Charging Infrastructure:

Coordinating vehicle charging schedules
with available charging stations in real time remains a significant challenge.
This can lead to missed opportunities for efficient charging and increased
operational costs.

Real-time coordination between vehicle charging
schedules and available charging stations is still a complex issue. This can
result in missed opportunities for optimal charging and higher operational
expenses.",,"Qualitative Impact:{Qualitative Impact,Internal},{Remarks,<p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-IN"">Predictive&#10;maintenance will revolutionize vehicle operations by proactively identifying&#10;and addressing potential issues before they escalate into costly breakdowns.&#10;This proactive approach will significantly reduce downtime, optimize&#10;maintenance schedules, and enhance overall operational efficiency.AI-powered&#10;analytics will transform data handling processes by automating data collection,&#10;cleaning, and analysis.

     development/ other support, employees first turn to their peers secondly
     asking their bosses. Majority gets desired way out at this level only.
     This is where PEER   Learning starts.There is a common perception that
     experts outside the organization are more knowledgeable & valuable
     than internal resource.Things gets ignored here is,
     organization has hired competent & smart people already and we are
     surrounded by them every day. How much could be gained if peers shared
     their expertise with each other to learn and build new skills. This way
     Peer-to-peer learning can be a powerful tool to breaks through some common
     barriers to skill-building.If we go by the first paragraph,
     Peer-to peer learning exists in almost all organization, though not
     formally. What needs to be done, to create a formal structure, tap into
     expertise that already exists in organization, start the process.Peer
     learning is a potentially powerful way of sharing knowledge. This learning
     involves individuals exchanging knowledge and experience with each other and potentially diffusing this learning back to their organizations to
     ensure an impact—at scale—on reform initiatives.While peer learning entails
     complex organizational logistics, it avoids the risk of focusing
     on process rather than product. It recognizes that
     ultimately learning takes place between individuals and it
     facilitates interpersonal interchanges that are well- matched and that are
     based on trust and commitment.

pharmacovigilance is evolving to meet the challenges of individualized
treatments. Pharmacovigilance - a game-changing approach that aligns drug safety
monitoring with patient-specific needs. 

Key
features of precision pharmacovigilance include: 

•
Integration of genetic profiling to predict drug responses and adverse
reactions 

• AI-powered
analysis of patient-specific data for rapid safety signal detection•
Real-time monitoring using digital health technologies and big data
analytics 

•
Enhanced post-market surveillance to evaluate long-term safety profiles

•
Creation of personalized medication leaflets with patient-specific risk information
by transforming healthcare facilities into hubs for patient data aggregation
and analysis, precision pharmacovigilance enables more informed treatment
decisions. 


 The
     AI framework for pharmacovigilance focuses on enhancing drug safety
     monitoring and risk assessment through drug and adverse effect
     detection, dynamic knowledge graph construction, and centrality-based
     analysis.
 In
     the drug and adverse effect detection task, Named Entity
     Recognition (NER) models are used to extract relevant entities from
     medical reports. Pretrained models fine-tuned on medical datasets
     accurately identify drug names and corresponding adverse effects, enabling
     early identification of potential risks.
 The
     second task involves building a dynamic knowledge graph, where
     drugs and their detected adverse effects are represented as nodes, and
     their relationships are mapped through edges. This evolving graph captures
     real-time updates as new data is ingested, providing a comprehensive view
     of drug safety.
 The
     third component is centrality analysis of the knowledge graph,
     which measures the importance of each drug node based on the number of
     affected persons. Centrality metrics such as degree centrality
     and betweenness centrality highlight drugs with higher risks,
     aiding in prioritizing regulatory actions.
 The
     entire system’s utility is enhanced by an agentic Generative AI-based
     Q&A bot that provides stakeholders with real-time insights and
     responses to queries regarding drug safety. Its performance is evaluated
     through response accuracy, user engagement, and query
     resolution time.

",NeoStar," Indrajit Kar (i.kar@zensar.com), Zonunfeli Ralte (zonunfeli.ralte@zensar.com)",Zensar Technologies,Yes,,Yes,"
 In drug
     and adverse effect detection, challenges arise from ambiguous
     medical terminology and variability in report formats, which
     can hinder the NER model’s performance. Handling rare adverse effects
     and improving entity disambiguation require continual updates and
     domain-specific training.
 For knowledge
     graph construction, managing heterogeneous data sources and
     ensuring real-time updates pose significant challenges. The graph
     must accommodate new drugs and effects without compromising consistency. Data
     sparsity in certain relationships can affect the graph’s reliability.
 Centrality
     analysis is complicated by incomplete or biased reporting of
     adverse effects, which can distort centrality scores. The Generative AI-based Q&A bot faces
challenges in contextual understanding and complex medical queries,
especially when dealing with nuanced or multi-drug scenarios. Continuous
learning and domain adaptation are crucial to maintaining accuracy and
relevance in its responses.",,"Qualitative Impact:{Qualitative Impact,External},{Remarks,<ul type=""disc"">&#10; <li class=""MsoNormal"">For <b>drug&#10;     and adverse effect detection</b>, key qualitative KPIs include <b>precision</b>,&#10;     <b>recall</b>, and <b>F1-score</b> of the NER model, which evaluate how&#10;     accurately the system extracts entities from unstructured medical text.&#10;     Another important metric is the <b>entity linking accuracy</b>, which&#10;     measures how well detected effects are associated with the correct drug.</li>&#10; <li class=""MsoNormal"">In <b>knowledge&#10;     graph construction</b>, the primary KPIs are <b>graph completeness</b> and&#10;     <b>edge accuracy</b>, which indicate how comprehensively and correctly&#10;     relationships between drugs and adverse effects are mapped.&#160;</li>&#10;</ul>&#10;&#10;<span>For <b>centrality analysis</b>, KPIs include <b>centrality&#10;score distribution</b> and <b>risk p</b></span><b><span>rioritization&#10;accuracy.</span></b>}","Realised so far:{Unit,INR},{Amount,},{Type,Impacting Revenue}","Projected Annually:{Unit,INR},{Amount,},{Type,Impacting Revenue}",Yes,90,

•Tire curing bladders are a flexible membrane that
forms the inside surface of a tire during the tire curing/vulcanizing process.

 

Importance of Bladder in Tire Industry…?

•Bladders are an important consumable component in
tire curing and are considered part of the plant’s stores/spares, budgeted
under OPEX/conversion costs.

•CEAT’s annual consumption of bladders is
approximately 1.40 lakh units, covering over 300 SKUs to
support all tire categories where in actual expenditure on bladders approximate
Rs 22 crore per annum is.

 

Project Background…?

•To achieve the annual budgeted Bladder OPEX,
continuous improvement in bladder life (i.e., the number of tires cured per
bladder) is essential. This can be achieved through process robustness and
handling, the use of appropriate bladder designs, formulation and manufacturing
improvements, and tire stretch mapping, among other factors.

Blockchain, a decentralized ledger system, offers a robust framework for managing energy transactions, ensuring transparency, security, and efficiency. This technology is poised to revolutionize the way energy is produced, distributed, and consumed, paving the way for a more sustainable and resilient energy future.Decentralization and Peer-to-Peer Energy TradingOne of the most significant impacts of blockchain in the energy sector is the facilitation of peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading. Traditional energy systems are centralized, with power generated by large plants and distributed through a complex grid. Blockchain disrupts this model by enabling individuals and businesses to trade energy directly with each other. Through smart contracts, blockchain automates and secures these transactions, ensuring that energy is bought and sold efficiently and transparently. This decentralization empowers consumers, reduces reliance on centralized utilities, and promotes the use of renewable energy sources.Enhanced Security and Fraud PreventionBlockchain's inherent security features are crucial for the energy sector, where data integrity and protection against cyber threats are paramount. Each transaction recorded on a blockchain is encrypted and linked to the previous one, creating an immutable chain of records. This makes it nearly impossible for malicious actors to alter or tamper with data. For energy companies, this means enhanced protection against fraud, hacking, and other cyber threats. Additionally, blockchain can secure the data generated by smart meters and IoT devices, ensuring accurate billing and preventing unauthorized access.Transparency and TrustTransparency is a cornerstone of blockchain technology, and it plays a vital role in building trust within the energy sector. All participants in a blockchain network have access to the same information, which is updated in real-time. This transparency ensures that all transactions are visible and verifiable, reducing disputes and fostering trust among consumers, producers, and regulators. For instance, consumers can verify the source of their energy, ensuring that they are indeed purchasing renewable energy. This level of transparency is particularly beneficial for regulatory compliance and reporting.Efficiency and Cost ReductionBlockchain can streamline various processes within the energy sector, leading to significant cost reductions and increased efficiency. By automating transactions and eliminating intermediaries, blockchain reduces administrative overhead and transaction costs. Smart contracts, which execute automatically when predefined conditions are met, can facilitate everything from energy trading to grid management. This automation not only speeds up processes but also reduces the potential for human error. Moreover, blockchain can optimize supply chain management for energy resources, ensuring timely and cost-effective delivery.Integration with Renewable EnergyThe integration of blockchain with renewable energy sources is a game-changer for the energy sector. Blockchain can support the tracking and certification of renewable energy credits (RECs), ensuring that energy produced from renewable sources is accurately accounted for and traded. This promotes the adoption of renewable energy by making it easier for consumers and businesses to participate in green energy markets. Additionally, blockchain can facilitate the management of decentralized renewable energy installations, such as solar panels and wind turbines, by enabling efficient energy distribution and storage.ConclusionBlockchain technology holds immense potential to transform the energy sector by promoting decentralization, enhancing security, and improving efficiency. As the world moves towards a more sustainable and resilient energy future, blockchain will play a critical role in enabling innovative solutions and fostering trust among all stakeholders. By leveraging blockchain, the energy sector can achieve greater transparency, reduce costs, and support the widespread adoption of renewable energy, ultimately powering a cleaner and more secure future.",Greenball, Mayank Agrawal (m.agrawal@zensar.com),Zensar Technologies,Yes,,Yes,,,"Qualitative Impact:{Qualitative Impact,External}","Realised so far:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}","Projected Annually:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}",Yes,103,

This whole process is manual and require so many efforts and force. As RVS tube size increase (RVS-14, RVS-15, RVS-30, RVS-35, RVS-40), more force is required, and approx. average 1 minute time is taking.This process can be made easy by providing micro air holes in the hollow metal rods fixed with working table and this rod will be connected with air flow from bottom side. So, while constant air blowing from those micro holes, RVS tube can be easy move/roll on rod while pin removal and while paper insertion. It is concept of air hockey table game which we are playing in malls. Instead of metal rod, we can also make rods with white fiber (same as our 200S product expansion mandrills) or any other material in which we can make micro holes with one side air inlet.This will surely reduce operator fatigue and improve ergonomics and instead of approx. 1 minute/part, it will be completed in 30 seconds/part.There will be huge impact in productivity and this process will not become bottleneck.",Greenball,,Raychem RPG,Yes,,No,"This idea is not executed till now.

Monthly datasets containing product details such as names, categories, chemical compositions, and types are compared against a verified ground truth dataset, which includes unique IDs associated with each product. This process ensures consistency and alignment with compliance standards. Traditionally, manual verification was used to match the unique IDs from the ground truth data with the input datasets. However, the increasing volume of data and the need for continuous updates made this approach time-consuming, error-prone, and resource-intensive. To address these challenges, an AI-driven solution was introduced to streamline the process. The system analyzes attributes like product names, categories, image URLs, and types, and matches them with entries in the ground truth dataset. It identifies the closest match for each product and tags it with the appropriate unique ID. Following the matching process, a detailed report is generated for review. This automated solution significantly reduces manual effort, accelerates processing timelines, and ensures a high level of accuracy and consistency, enabling efficient management of extensive and evolving datasets. ",Darwin, Prashanth Raja (p.raja@zensar.com),Zensar Technologies,Yes,,Yes,"Creating a chunking logic that maintains a balance between granularity and context relevance, avoiding the loss of coherence in smaller chunks or the omission of nuances in larger ones. Refining prompts based on human review feedback, ensuring outputs meet accuracy requirements while minimizing disruption to workflows. ",,"Qualitative Impact:{Qualitative Impact,External},{Remarks,<div><b>Improved Data Accuracy &amp; Enhanced Compliance:</b> The AI ensures accurate product match, eliminates errors that could lead to compliance violations.&#160;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Increased Efficiency:</b> Automation reduces product id match time by 90%, allows quick inventory updates in real-time.&#160;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Scalability:</b> The solution can handle client&#8217;s growing data volumes effortlessly, accommodating complex datasets.&#160;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Cost Reduction:</b> Operational costs reduced by a factor of 10, enabling significant savings.&#160;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Processing Speed: </b>Processing time for monthly datasets reduced from weeks to hours, accelerating client&#8217;s supply chain operations.&#160;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Capacity Expansion:</b> Client can now handle 10 times the volume of product data, positioning the retailer for further growth.&#160;</div>}","Realised so far:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}","Projected Annually:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}",Yes,31,

Below are key challenges associated with implementing gamification in IT training, along with strategies to mitigate them.1. Designing Meaningful GamificationShallow Engagement: Overly simplistic or irrelevant game mechanics can lead to a lack of engagement or interest from participants.Alignment with Goals: Ensuring that game elements align with learning objectives and do not distract from the core content.2. Balancing Fun and LearningOveremphasis on Entertainment: Gamification that prioritizes fun over learning can dilute the educational value.Cognitive Overload: Complex game elements may overwhelm learners, making it harder to focus on the content.3. Resistance to ChangeCultural Resistance: Some participants or organizations may view gamification as unnecessary or frivolous.Skepticism Among Participants: Learners accustomed to traditional methods may find gamification unappealing or distracting.4. Maintaining Long-Term EngagementLoss of Interest Over Time: Participants may initially engage with gamified elements but lose interest if the system becomes repetitive.Plateauing Motivation: If rewards or achievements are too easy to earn or lack progression, motivation can stagnate.5. Technological LimitationsPlatform Constraints: Gamification tools may not integrate seamlessly with existing IT infrastructure or LMS platforms.Performance Issues: Poorly optimized gamified platforms can lead to slow performance and frustration.6. Measuring EffectivenessDifficult Metrics: Assessing the impact of gamification on learning outcomes can be complex.Superficial Metrics: Relying on engagement metrics (e.g., time spent, points earned) without evaluating actual skill development.7. Personalization and InclusivityOne-Size-Fits-All Approach: Uniform gamified elements may not appeal to diverse learning styles or skill levels.Exclusion Risks: Participants unfamiliar with gaming concepts or lacking technical skills may feel left out.8.

Project managers may require specialized skills for specific tasks but do not need full-time employees. This creates a gap where companies struggle to find flexible, cost-effective solutions to meet their dynamic project needs. Additionally, experts looking for part-time opportunities may find it difficult to connect with organizations that require their skills.  Solution Overview The proposed platform effectively addresses these challenges by seamlessly connecting project managers (demand) with senior experts or part-time employees (supply) through an integrated system. This platform enables experts to register their availability and skills, while project managers can submit specific project requirements. Utilizing OpenAI Azure services, the platform facilitates an intelligent matching process, ensuring that the most suitable experts are assigned to the right projects. Additionally, the system tracks hours worked and manages payments, providing a transparent and efficient workflow for both parties.
We have developed a Large Language Model (LLM) designed to optimize candidate selection based on priority-based tasks. This model operates similarly to ride-sharing platforms like Uber, Ola, or Rapido. It prioritizes assigning tasks to individuals who have not had any assignments for the day and are located nearby. If no such candidates are available, the model selects individuals who are nearby, finishing their current tasks, and have had fewer assignments throughout the day. This iterative process ensures that the most suitable candidate is selected, effectively managing the pool of available personnel. By leveraging this model, we can better manage our bench resources and utilize employees who are partially occupied (e.g., 50% engaged in projects). This approach can lead to significant cost savings, potentially reducing company expenses by more than 10%. ",Greenball, Narayana Prasad Shankar (narayanaprasad.shankar@zensar.com),Zensar Technologies,Yes,,Yes,"This platform provides a flexible and efficient solution for matching part-time experts with project needs, facilitating cost-effective project delivery.

Currently, the surface inspection for defects as small as 0.5 microns is performed manually by operators using a magnifying glass. This process is not only time-consuming but also prone to human error.To improve this, we set out to automate the inspection process using computer vision technology. We engaged with nearly 10 different vendors who are leaders in this field to find a solution. The primary challenge was the nature of the cable joint’s surface, which is glossy and semi-transparent. This made it difficult for standard computer vision systems to detect defects accurately.Additionally, the inspection process required the part to be rotated 360 degrees to ensure a thorough examination of the entire surface. This added another layer of complexity, as the system needed to maintain precision while the part was in motion.Despite extensive trials and collaborations, we were unable to develop a foolproof system that could perform both surface inspection and dimension measurement in a single workstation.

is Set-up in Tyre Building Process?
Tyre
Building machine is used for producing Carcass which is the 1st stage of Green tyre making. In TBM (Tyre
Building Machine) we need to do set-ups based on SKUs, where we will be
replacing Drums and its accessories. Since Ceat Speciality business has 700
plus SKUs, our set-ups are more compared to other CEAT plants, We faced a problem in this set-up process.

Problem Statement
As explained
about the set-up, we do average 4 set-up per machine which is quite high.
During this we remove the finger assembly and fixes
the next upcoming SKUs Finger assembly with a bolting mechanism mounted on the
main shaft of TBM. Due to its heaviness and multiple changeovers the
threads of the main shaft (Shaft -3.5Mtrs Long and 0.25 Mtr in
diameter) getting worn out very frequently. 

To rectify this the entire main shaft of 3.5 Mtrs long
and 0.25 Mtrs in dia has to be dismantled from the machine and send
to outside workshop for correction. This requires a minimum time of 24Hrs to
put the machine back in operation. Huge production loss, extra manpower and
cost involved in this correction activity.",NeoStar," Ajit Chavan (ajit.chavan@ceat.com), Milind Patil (milind.patil@ceat.com)",CEAT,Yes,,No,"Challenges:
To overcome this problem we
approached the OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) and
they couldn’t help us in this. But we kept
tyring with new thoughts like, increasing the bolt size, bolt material, torque
wrench for limiting the tightening torque etc. We didn’t
got the
desired results a expected. Finally we
thought of working on the main shafts design without compromising on Safety,
Quality and Cost.

Solution:
Keeping Safety, Quality and Cost as the main factor and after multiple PDCA, We
came out with a unique design change in the main shaft. The main shaft has been
split into two pieces, where the main shaft which carries the entire load of drum and
its accessories remain same in its position. An additional Quick Fix
Ring with high strength and load carrying capacity is introduced
in the main shaft.

Now the Finger assembly will be fixed in this Quick Fix Ring and this ring
consists of extra additional mountings as well. Incase of
any thread worn out after multiple set-ups this ring will be rotated to the
next PCD in less than 5 minutes and the finger assembly will be mounted on the next set of PCDs.
Once all the PCDs threads got damaged, the Quick fix ring alone will be
replaced in less than 5mins time with removing the main shaft.",,"Qualitative Impact:{Qualitative Impact,Internal},{Remarks,}","Realised so far:{Unit,INR},{Amount,300000},{Type,Cost Saving}","Projected Annually:{Unit,INR},{Amount,1200000},{Type,Cost Saving}",Yes,132,

Here's a high-level use case and overview of how this might work:Use Case: Optimizing Risk Assessment in Insurance UnderwritingObjective:Leverage quantum computing to optimize complex risk assessment models, which are critical in underwriting insurance policies, by integrating D-Wave's quantum cloud with Guidewire's InsuranceSuite via its Cloud Integration API.1. Risk Assessment Optimization- Current Challenges:  - Complex Models: Insurance underwriting relies on complex models to evaluate risk, often involving numerous variables and requiring significant computational resources.  - Combinatorial Optimization: Many underwriting problems can be modeled as combinatorial optimization problems, where traditional computing might struggle with finding optimal solutions efficiently.- Quantum Advantage:  - Quantum Annealing: D-Wave's quantum computers are particularly well-suited for solving combinatorial optimization problems, potentially providing better solutions faster than classical computers.  - Parallel Processing: Quantum processing can evaluate many possible scenarios simultaneously, improving the accuracy and speed of risk assessments.2. Integration with Guidewire Cloud- Guidewire Cloud Integration APIs:  - Data Extraction: Use Guidewire’s APIs to extract relevant data (e.g., historical claims data, policyholder information, external data sources) from InsuranceSuite.  - Data Preprocessing: Process and format the extracted data for compatibility with quantum algorithms (e.g., encoding data into a quantum-readable format).  - Quantum Processing: Send the preprocessed data to D-Wave’s quantum cloud service for computation. This might involve solving complex optimization problems related to risk pricing, portfolio optimization, or fraud detection.  - Results Integration: Once the quantum computation is completed, the results are sent back to Guidewire’s environment using the Cloud Integration APIs. These results could be used to adjust underwriting models, set premium prices, or inform decision-making processes.3. Benefits- Efficiency: Quantum computing can significantly reduce the time required to run complex risk models, leading to faster underwriting decisions.- Accuracy: By exploring a broader solution space more efficiently, quantum computing can help identify more accurate risk factors, leading to better pricing and reduced risk exposure.- Scalability: As insurance companies deal with larger datasets and more complex models, integrating quantum computing offers a scalable solution that grows with the data.4. Implementation Considerations- Security: Ensure that data transferred between Guidewire and the D-Wave quantum cloud is secure, possibly involving encryption and secure APIs.- Compatibility: Work with data scientists to ensure that the quantum algorithms used are compatible with the data structures and models in use within Guidewire’s systems.- Performance Monitoring: Regularly monitor the performance of the quantum integration to ensure that it is providing a tangible benefit over classical methods.5. Example Workflow1. Data Extraction: Retrieve claims data from Guidewire's PolicyCenter via the Cloud Integration API.2. Data Transformation: Format this data into a problem that can be optimized using quantum annealing.3. Quantum Processing: Send the problem to D-Wave's quantum cloud to find the optimal solution.</span",Kahuna, Parthasarathy Vemppati (parthasarathy.v@zensar.com),Zensar Technologies,Yes,,Yes,,,"Qualitative Impact:{Qualitative Impact,External}","Realised so far:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}","Projected Annually:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}",Yes,51,

major incidents happened at our region we have decided to develop one
innovative idea as per root cause of the incidents.

ØIn both cases the root cause was the same
as activity was taken up at site without any intimation to the Safety team as
well as Section in Charge.

ØAs it is very tough to track the entire workforce (Workmen) of a project, that is why we tried to target to track the
equipment like ladder/ ladder trolley which is on or near live track.
Obviously, Work can’t execute without this equipment.



ØWe are the first who had brought the idea
to track the vehicles through GPS device and now it has become a regular
practice in every railway project on pan India basis.

ØThis time we introduced the idea to use
portable GPS device with inbuilt battery on ladder & ladder trolleys to
track the entire work force thru this equipment.

ØWith this we merged the Geo fencing
technique of Raksha App which is being used for attendance purpose.

ØWe have Geo Fenced the entire railway
track to get instant voice notification like UPI payment whenever there is
movement on or near the railway track. How does it work.ØFor creation of geo fencing only lines to
be drawn on the map through the web application.

ØThere is no need to fetch exact
co-ordinates from entire sites.

ØOnly required area of geo fence to be
close looped by keeping starting point and ending point same. i.e.
if we start to draw a straight line from point A, then B, C, D, E, F…. And then
again to finish at point A.

ØJust like our LOP (Lay out plan) the
geofencing also to be done for each sub section. This will enable us to get the
notification with mentioning the subsection name.

ØEach GPS device to be named same as it’s
identification ID which is maintained at store & is available with Safety
officer & Safety Team.

ØSafety officer can easily identify
which staffs is entering into which Geo fence zone with the help of the tools
issue register as Issued person name is there against each identification ID.

ØThus, no team can enter railway track
bypassing our Safety officer. 



ØAt the end of work safety officer can
ensure that no ladder or such equipment left near/on the railway track by
ensuring the exit notification and by monitoring through Web/Mobile
application. Cost & BenefitØThe cost of this GPS device is Rs 3,500/-
per unit and Rs 200/- per month per device for Server Subscription, SIM card,
maintenance & getting notifications.

ØThe device consisting of inbuilt battery
of 10000mAh. It takes 4 to 5 Hrs to get full charged and can provide service up
to 15 days (in 24 x 7 on condition)

ØDue to very small size and light weight
can be easily fitted on the working tools like ladder & ladder trolleys.

ØAny team going to site must carry
ladder/ladder trolley and hence they will be at our radar all the time.

ØAnyone can take access with this
device who can receive notification and take control of that gang who has
neither informed nor communicated.",Darwin," Chayan Das (dasc01@kecrpg.com), Gautam Chaudhary (chaudhuryg@kecrpg.com), Nabajit Baruah (baruahn@kecrpg.com)",KEC,No, Chayan Das (dasc01@kecrpg.com),Yes,"ØIn view of Investigation of recent two

Several documents in the Teams chat are needed for Q&A, accessed by multiple teams for various benefits. We require a scalable framework for consistent document upload and a direct method to upload these documents into customer’s chatbot for real-time parsing and automated Q&A.Our Solution:1. Centralized Data Access for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):Problem solved: Users need a way to manage and access files uploaded in Teams channels for use in a RAG-based application.How: This solution allows for the seamless transfer of files from Teams channels to the custom application. It fetches the file from SharePoint (where it is stored after being uploaded to Teams) and processes it through the frontend before uploading it to AWS OpenSearch. This setup enables the RAG-based application to access the processed data efficiently.2. Automated Data Processing and Indexing:Problem solved: Data needs to be processed and indexed in a way that is optimized for search and retrieval.How: By processing the file data before it is sent to AWS OpenSearch, the solution ensures that data is embedded and indexed properly with the correct file. This makes it easier for the RAG-based system to access relevant data during queries, improving the accuracy and speed of responses.3. Enhanced Search Capabilities for Uploaded Files:Problem solved: Users need to be able to perform complex searches on files that have been uploaded to Teams.How: By storing the processed data in AWS OpenSearch, the solution enables powerful search and query capabilities. Users can easily find relevant information from the files using advanced search functionalities, facilitating a better user experience within the RAG-based application.4. Real-time Data Retrieval for AI Applications:Problem solved: AI models need timely access to newly uploaded data for generating accurate and relevant results.How: The solution provides a streamlined workflow where files uploaded in Teams are quickly processed and made available in AWS OpenSearch. This ensures that the AI model has access to up-to-date information, improving the relevance and reliability of the generated responses.5. Scalable Document Management System:Problem solved: As the number of uploaded files increases, the solution must handle larger volumes of data efficiently.How: By leveraging AWS OpenSearch for storage and indexing, the system can scale to handle growing amounts of data. It ensures that as more files are uploaded, the search and retrieval performance remain consistent, making the solution suitable for large-scale enterprise use.Overall, this solution effectively addresses the need for integrating Teams, data processing, and advanced search capabilities into a single workflow, allowing AI-driven applications to function more effectively with high-quality data inputs.",Equinox," Rahul Madhusudan Joshi (rahul.joshi1@zensar.com), Nimesh Shah (nimesh.shah@zensar.com)",Zensar Technologies,Yes,,Yes,"1. Authentication and Authorization:   Challenge: Integrating Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for authentication and securing API access through Microsoft Graph API required careful configuration of permissions like `Sites.ReadWrite.All` and `Files.ReadWrite.All`.  Impact: Incorrect configuration could result in access issues or data exposure, potentially blocking access to necessary files or compromising security.  Solution: This was addressed by setting up a clear process for registering the application in Azure AD, obtaining proper credentials (tenantId, clientId, clientSecret), and thoroughly testing API access with the correct permissions. 2. Managing Data Transfer Between Services:  Challenge: Extracting files from Microsoft Teams, accessing SharePoint, and then transferring data to the custom frontend for further processing involved complex data flow management.  Impact: Managing the flow of data across different services could lead to delays, inconsistencies, or failures if not handled correctly.  Solution: Implementing error handling, retries for failed API requests, and logging mechanisms ensured data transfer reliability between Teams, SharePoint, and the custom application. 3. Handling Large Files and Data Processing:  Challenge: Processing large files uploaded through Teams and transforming them for embedding in AWS OpenSearch was resource-intensive and time-consuming.  Impact: This could lead to performance bottlenecks, slow processing times, or memory overload during the embedding and uploading stages.  Solution: To overcome this, batch processing techniques and parallel processing were used to optimize file handling. Additionally, resource limits were adjusted in the cloud infrastructure to accommodate larger files. 4. Data Format Compatibility Between Systems:  Challenge: The format of data retrieved from SharePoint and the structure required for indexing in AWS OpenSearch could vary, requiring transformations.  Impact: Inconsistent data formats could lead to indexing errors or reduce the effectiveness of the search functionality.  Solution: Data transformation logic was implemented to normalize file data into a consistent structure before uploading it to AWS OpenSearch, ensuring compatibility and improving search performance. 5. Ensuring Real-Time Data Availability:   Challenge:  Ensuring that files uploaded to Teams channels are processed and made available in AWS OpenSearch in near real-time for the RAG-based application.  Impact: Any delays in processing could result in outdated information being used by the AI model, affecting the accuracy of responses.  Solution: This was addressed by designing an efficient pipeline with minimal processing latency, using background workers to handle data processing in real-time, ensuring timely updates to the OpenSearch index. 6. Optimizing Search Indexes for RAG Applications:  Challenge: Designing the OpenSearch index in a way that supports the specific needs of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models, such as optimizing for text embeddings.  Impact: Poorly structured indexes could reduce the speed and accuracy of search queries, negatively affecting the performance of the RAG-based system.  Solution: Fine-tuning the schema and indexing strategy in AWS OpenSearch, including using custom analyzers and indexing strategies for textual data, allowed for more precise and efficient search results. These challenges were key to refining the solution, ensuring that it not only met the technical requirements but also provided a secure, scalable, and efficient workflow from data ingestion to advanced search capabilities in a RAG-based application.",,"Qualitative Impact:{Qualitative Impact,External}","Realised so far:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}","Projected Annually:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}",Yes,5,

This process improvisation will save specifically storage cost of store for at least 6 months. In addition, below are some cost benefits by opting this process. 
 Reduced
     Storage Costs: Minimizes the need for the supplier to store items,
     reducing storage costs and potential risks associated with prolonged
     storage. Reducing storage time and
     associated costs can lead to significant savings.


 


 Improved
     Cash Flow: Facilitates quicker invoicing and payment processes,
     improving cash flow for the supplier


 


 Risk
     Mitigation: Reduces the risk of damage or theft of materials from
     store of items while in the supplier's possession, as the responsibility
     is transferred to the client immediately.Efficiency:
Streamlining the handover process reduces delays and ensures that the client
receives the items as soon as possible, enhancing overall efficiency. This
reduces the risk of overuse or misuse of materials for using at site from spare
materials which leads to shortages in spare materials at last during handing
over time.Timely
store closure: With fewer materials to manage, the site can close its store
more efficiently. This helps in wrapping up the project on time and reduces the

endangers your employees, clients, or the public; or risks disrupting your
workplace operations; or causes damage. Emergencies can take many forms, but
will largely fall into three categories — natural, work-related, and external.

Emergencies can happen at any time in any types of industry,
due to fire in process area, tank form area, toxic gas/liquid release
into the area from storage vessels or piping network, or a bomb threat, earthquake,
storm etc.

At the time of emergency, the response is the most important
and critical. Because the response can increase and can reduce the risk of
emergency.

As a immediate response to the emergency we are following -
cordoned off area, Plant put off. All are evacuated to the assembly Point.
Organize preventive measures such as removal of dangerous materials from other
buildings to safer location. Guide and instruct the fire squad to conduct
rescue and search. 

From the above first immediate response activities,
evacuation and gathering at assembly point is the very critical. In any case
any employee or visitor trapped inside plant that will become most dangerous
situation and sometimes it become late while manual head count at assembly
point and not matching the entered head count in the premises or plant.

Idea here is to reduce the above risk in emergency
situations that – we should add microchip in the Icard of all employees and
microchip in the visitor Icard as well. This digital chip works on concept of
sim card or GPS system which is connected with our internal server or system by
which we can see the microchip movement (person movement) and location in the
factory and in the premises in the security TV screen. It works like local satellite
which is keeping watch on person movement inside plant. So, if in any
case any person is getting stuck at any location during emergency, we can trace
him/her and rescue immediately from danger situation. This will definitely save
someone’s live in emergency. Also, head count can be counted automatically by
system.

Our small step and unique idea of adding this digital touch in
our emergency management situation will really be helpful for us and for all stakeholders.",Greenball,,Raychem RPG,Yes,,Yes,"This is idea and we must try and explore mote in it. if it works successfully, it can become gamechanger for emergency situation handling. ",,"Qualitative Impact:{Qualitative Impact,Internal},{Remarks,Rescue the person from danger emergency situation and saving someone's life.}","Realised so far:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}","Projected Annually:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}",Yes,133,

a tanker is received at the factory, the stores person verifies all the
paperwork that came with it and prepares a Good Receiving Report (GRR). The
stores department then sends the GRR to the QC department as information that
the tanker is being sampled.
It will take roughly eight to ten hours to analysis the sample after the tanker
has been sampled. 

Therefore, the unloading process usually occurs on the second day following the
tanker's receipt. 

After approval given by QC, the stores department takes 4-5 hours for unloading
the tanker, again the stores department is send intimation to the QC department
for analysis of the unloading sample (Mix sample). 
QC takes another 8–10 hours to analysis the unloaded sample. 

 

Due
to this stores department not able to issue solvent (which is received in
tanker) to production/user department almost 1.5 working days after unloading
of solvent tanker. Proposed Idea:Reducing the chemical analysis
procedure of solvent after tanker unloading (Which is performed by QC-API Navi Mumbai)
base on the trend/history data of analysis of mix unloaded solvent sample. It will help to save time
of analysis as well as cost of analysis  











Note: Proposed idea
practice has been implemented in other API industry/factory’s. To implement this idea
following things to be done:1)     
Initiate the change control by QC 2)     
Trend/History data to be generate. 





3)

Our innovative solution “Generative AI-based Regulatory Compliance Checker” automates the analysis of banking policies, systems, and transactions to ensure adherence to regulations like the Dodd-Frank Act, FCA & BoE rules, GDPR, and FSRA. By leveraging AI, it simplifies regulatory interpretation, identifies non-compliance risks, and delivers actionable reports, reducing manual effort and ensuring real-time compliance and data governance integrity. Problem StatementTheres is a web of dynamic and complex regulations that Bank needs to follow. Traditional compliance processes struggle with scalability and efficiency. Penalties for non-compliance can reach up to $20M or 4% of annual turnover of bank.Banking institutions face significant challenges in regulatory compliance due to:Frequent Regulatory Updates: Regulatory updates require continuous monitoring, implementation, and regular compliance assessments to ensure accountability.Infrastructure Limitations: Many banks operate on aging legacy systems that are incompatible with modern compliance tools. Additionally, disparate systems in multinational banks create inefficiencies in ensuring compliance across regions.Data Governance: Inadequate controls over customer data lead to risks of breaches or misuse, violating laws such as GDPR (UK/EU), CCPA (US), and South Africa’s POPIA (Protection of Personal Information Act).Interpretation Complexity: Regulations such as the BSA’s AML requirements or FCA liquidity thresholds often include ambiguous legal or technical language, making them hard to implement correctly. Solution / Recommendation:Our innovative AI-driven solution is tailored to meet the regulatory needs of banks in the US, UK, and South Africa.A Generative AI-based Regulatory Compliance Checker performs the following:Regulation Interpretation: Uses natural language understanding (NLU) to extract and summarize key requirements from regulatory documents, generating simplified summaries or mappings of how rules apply to specific banking processes.Policy & System Scanning: Analyses internal policies, workflows, and transaction logs to detect gaps or deviations from compliance requirements, and suggests modifications to align policies or systems with regulationsAutomated Reporting & Insights: Prepares submission-ready documents for SEC (US), FCA (UK), or FSCA (South Africa) audits, and provides risk prioritization dashboards to streamline regulator communicationsContinuous Monitoring: Tracks new regulatory updates in real-time, assesses their impact on the institution, and generates alerts or required action plans.Robust Data Governance Framework: Aligns with data privacy laws like GDPR (UK/EU), CCPA (US), and POPIA (South Africa), and implements data encryption and lineage tracking to maintain compliance and data integrity.",Greenball," Bharat Jejurkar (bharat.jejurkar@zensar.com), Soundarya Cholkar (soundarya.cholkar@zensar.com)",Zensar Technologies,Yes, Ajinkya Penmahale (ajinkya.penmahale@zensar.com),Yes,"Understanding Regulatory Ambiguity - Regulations vary by jurisdiction and are often written in complex legal language.

crucial tyre machinery that assembles all components such as tread, sidewall,
inner liner, body ply, bead, and cord body together to build green tyres. In
the machine a drum is used for building green tyres of various sizes.

The innovation is about to reduce set up time
loss during size change over on Tyre Building Machine (TBM). In set up change
we need to change drum, bladder, finger & bead clamp which is a sequence of
15 steps. In our case we have 20 sizes of different width which run on 2 drum
sizes of perimeters 1700 & 2300mm. 

The size of the bladder for 1700 mm & 2300
mm drums are 22.5 inch & 24 inch respectively & this bladder change is
required as per the machine manufacturer during every drum change.

The maximum time-consuming activity is bladder
change which consists of 10 steps. In our new system we increased the inflation
time of 22.5 inch bladder in the PLC recipe & used it for 2300 mm drum.
This has eliminated the bladder change activity during set up change which
reduced the no of steps from 15 to 5 Nos.The setup change is
a requirement which is to be performed with a frequency of 2-3 days. We could not avoid setup
change, but we thought of reducing the time loss during setup change.



We asked the OEM
but they said it is mandatory to do bladder change during every drum change.
So, we challenged the OEM & optimized the system by doing changes in the
recipe. And now the machine can run multiple sizes on different drums with the
same bladder. This is an innovation as it is a unique machine which doesn’t
exists anywhere in the tyre industry. ",Darwin,,CEAT,No, Rabindra Senapati (rabindra.senapati@ceat.com),No,"1)

In the bustling world of software development, efficiency and
precision are paramount. At the heart of this innovation was a team faced with
the daunting task of reverse engineering a complex application. The project
required meticulous documentation of requirements, a process that traditionally
consumed countless hours and resources.

Enter the Object Star Expert, a brilliant solution devised by
the team. This expert was not a person, but a sophisticated system designed to
evaluate object star code and seamlessly convert it into business domain
language. The goal was to generate comprehensive business documentation with
minimal manual intervention.

The implementation of the Object Star Expert was nothing short
of revolutionary. By automating the translation of technical code into
business-friendly documentation, the team was able to bypass the intensive
process of manual documentation. This innovation not only ensured accuracy but
also significantly reduced the time required for analysis.

The results were astounding. The team saved over 5 weeks in
analyzing the complex application, a testament to the power of their innovative
approach. This newfound efficiency allowed them to focus on other critical
aspects of the project, driving progress and fostering a culture of continuous
improvement.

The success of the Gen-AI, Object Star Expert highlighted the
importance of thinking outside the box and leveraging technology to solve
intricate problems. It served as an inspiring example of how innovation can
transform workflows, enhance productivity, and ultimately lead to greater
achievements.

financial services industry, knowledge workers often spend a significant amount
of time manually collecting information from disparate systems, combining that
data, and extracting key insights to create personalized offers, proposals,
investment summaries, and other documents. This process typically involves
navigating multiple systems and data sources, requiring workers to manually
compile and synthesize the information before they can draft, review, and
deliver final documents.

 

 

 

The integration of
automation, generative AI, and existing API capabilities presents an innovative
solution to streamline these workflows and dramatically reduce the time and
effort involved in document creation and data processing. This can help shift much
of the workload from human workers to an intelligent, automated system.

 

By using APIs to
integrate various data sources—CRM systems, transaction platforms, market data
feeds, customer profiles, etc.—, we can ensure that all relevant information is
automatically pulled through API’s, removing the need for manual data
collection and combining.

 

By leveraging generative AI models, AI can
automatically extract relevant insights from data, generate summaries, and fill
in predefined templates with client and financial data. This automates the
document creation process, significantly reducing time spent on manual data
entry and formatting. Real-time updates allow workers to have the most
up-to-date information in their documents, ensuring timely and accurate client
deliverables.

 

 

With automation handling data collection,
document drafting, and insights extraction, human workers can focus on
high-value tasks such as reviewing and refining AI-generated drafts, engaging
with clients, and making strategic decisions. This allows workers to use their
expertise where it adds the most value, such as ensuring compliance and
managing risks.

 

This combination of AI-driven automation and
data integration enables faster, more efficient document generation, reducing
manual work and freeing up knowledge workers to focus on strategic,
customer-facing tasks. This innovation leads to increased productivity,
scalability, and faster response times, ultimately driving business growth and
customer satisfaction.Verticalization of this solution across banking and financial industry is doable in few weeks with every sub domain specific context",Greenball, Gayathri N V S (gayathri.nvs@zensar.com),Zensar Technologies,Yes,,Yes,"-

the system is to have end to end traceability for the product i.e., from
manufacturing unit to the service.Currently in field it's difficult to address the
product traceability and exact location handling/ movement of product stock
from plant manufacturing unit to warehousing, CFA, DC and to end customer.In manufacturing operation product inventory, First In First Out ( FIFO
) , 4M Traceability, Human error prevention and product tracking are some of
the challenges that are faced which are tedious.

low due to lack of motivation and delayed results. Our innovative
Gen-AI-powered health app leverages RPG Happiness Coins to gamify
healthy habits. By offering tangible rewards for wellness milestones, it
transforms health journeys into exciting, incentivized experiences. Focused on
preventive care, the app enhances employee engagement, promotes well-being, and
positions RPG as a leader in innovative health solutions. Problem Statement:Key issues in the current wellness app ecosystem include:1    High Dropout Rates: Many users abandon apps
due to a lack of motivation or visible progress.2   Delayed Gratification: Health and fitness
outcomes take time, leaving users feeling unrewarded in the short term.3    Lack of Engagement: Apps fail to sustain
interest, leading to boredom and discontinued use.4  Insufficient Incentives: Most apps don’t offer
real, tangible rewards, reducing the incentive to stick with healthy habits. Solution / Recommendation:Our Gen-AI-powered health app integrates RPG Happiness
Coins as part of its unique gamification strategy:1   Gamification Elements: Users earn Happiness
Coins by completing wellness milestones such as daily steps, workouts, or
mindful activities.2  AI-Driven Personalization: Gen-AI provides
real-time insights and adaptive health plans tailored to each user's progress
and behaviour.3  Preventive Health Focus: Encourages daily health
activities, fostering long-term wellness rather than reactive health measures.4 Reward-Based Motivation: Happiness Coins can be
redeemed for various perks, creating immediate gratification for long-term
health efforts.

This process was not only time-consuming but also dependent on manual intervention, which often led to delays and inconsistencies in vehicle access management. Additionally, it required a dedicated security person at the gate, contributing to increased manpower costs and reduced operational efficiency.To overcome these issues and improve the efficiency and accuracy of vehicle access control, we installed an automated Boom Barrier System at both the entry and exit gates for allowed vehicles. The new system is integrated with RFID technology, which plays a critical role in automating the access control process. The boom barrier is an automated system that controls the entry and exit of vehicles by automatically raising or lowering a barrier arm when authorized vehicles approach. RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tags are provided to authorized vehicles, which are installed in the vehicle’s windshield or on the vehicle itself.

  and enhance market responsiveness while maintaining product quality and cost

    Key activities include analyzing historical sales data and demand patterns,
  defining appropriate safety stock levels, restructuring manufacturing
  processes, and aligning supply chain operations with the new model. The
  transition aims to improve customer satisfaction by ensuring faster product
  availability and reducing dependence on custom orders. Stakeholders from

    During the curing process, mat labels are currently heat-transferred onto
  the mats. To establish a Make-To-Stock (MTS) system, this labelling process
  needs to be shifted to the final step of production. By doing so,
  continuous-length mats can be maintained in stock at the class level. When an
  order is received, the specific class inventory can be selected, the label
  marking can be applied, and the material dispatched accordingly.
    
    The selection of the appropriate technology for permanent labeling on
  rubber mats was a critical decision. Various options were evaluated,
  including offline heat transfer pre-printed labels, UV digital printing,
  pad/screen printing, and digital laser printing. After extensive trials and

Sag is defined as the different in level between
points of
supports and the lowest point on the conductor is called Null point.



Sag
is mandatory in transmission line conductor suspension. The
conductors are attached
between two
supports with perfect value of sag .It is because of providing safety of the conductor
from not
to be subjected to excessive tension. In order to permit safe tension in the conductor,
conductors are
not fully stretched; rather they
are allowed
to have sag.
If the
conductor is stretched fully during
installation,
wind exerts pressure on the
conductor,
hence conductor gets chance to be broken or detached from its end support, in
worst condition
tower can collapse. Thus sag is
allowed to
have during conductor suspensionSAG SCOPE is used to observe the
conductor sag during the installation of overhead transmission line, and help
the operator to adjust the sag of conductor. The telescope of SAG SCOPE has the
feature of big objective diameter, wide view field, high magnification.Advantage of Using SAG scope than

Client timesheet (internal to Client project)b. In Fieldglass (or similar tool based on that client will pay to Zensar)c. Zensar timesheetPractically it is a pain to fill timesheet three times. 2.  Zensar existing timesheet system doesn't allow to log This is creating a big mismatch between client timesheet and Zensar timesheet. Ideally Zensar timesheet should accept any number of hours.3. Zensar leave management system has only half day or full day leave.  One cannot apply for hourly basis say for 1 hour or 2 hours of leave.  4. After applying half day leave in MyLeave, one has to wait for manager to approve the leave and till then one cannot submit the timesheet for that half leave day.  The timesheet need total 8 hours 4 hours leave + 4 hour working = 8 hours.   One cannot submit timesheet until half day leave gets approved. 5. Currently
comp off hours can be applied only for work done in weekend or on holiday
(limited to 3 comp off per month). If employee work extra hours during
weekdays for the client (& the client is giving the billing for extra hours)
then existing system is does not support to apply for equivalent number of
hours of comp off leave or with
equivalent payback system. For example, If an employee worked one hour extra
every day for a week or two weeks or month for the client, the existing
timesheet system does not automatically add comp off leave hours.6. Once can apply only 3 comp off in a month even though one has more comp off leave.   7. One has to fill the Zensar timesheet within 15 days else the system will not allow to log the timesheet. It will be considered as a leave. 8. To revert this leave, 2 levels of approval is required.9. Number of people required and spending time to revert or correct the timesheet are:1. Employee himself/herself need to apply for the correction 2.  1st level manger3. 2nd level manager4. Leave-on-line team5. HR if required All above give us the opportunity to think on innovating in the form of simplifying the timesheet and leave management system and process.Proposal:1.  No timesheet for non-billable employees. Why do we need timesheet for them? 2. For billable employee take the Fieldgass timesheet that employee has filled. Integrate Zensar timesheet application with Fieldgass timesheet or similar application used. (there are ways we can integrate). With that billable employees don't need to fill the Zensar timesheet and management will be simplified. Let's do the critical thinking on no timesheet for non-billable employees:    1.  Since employees are non-billable and they are on fixed salary then what is the point of logging the timesheet? Why unnecessary additional process to be maintain and what benefit will we get with that? For leave they can simplify apply in leave management system but no timesheet on daily basis.   2. At the end of the day organization look at the outcome and that we want to measure rather than timesheet that employee has filled. We trust our leaders and mangers and our employees. 3.  What is our assumption? Is our base assumption one wants to work? or one doesn't want to work but need salary?  If we our base assumption is one doesn't want to work, then we need to ask and look at our hiring process. What kind of people are we hiring? Also need to look at the Zensar culture. What kind of Organization it will build over the period of time?There
are many more points on which we can do critical thinking on this item as
required. 

Let's
look at other companies as well

is used for many different purposes. One of major used of plastic bubble sheet
is for packaging the product and material.

Packaging is the largest source of plastic pollution on our
planet. If plastic packing waste is not properly segregated and recycle then it
will become major problem for the environment.

The raw material used to make plastic bubble wrap, comes
from non-renewable fossil fuels and is well-known for contributing to pollution
and marine debris.
According to a WWF report, the amount of plastic in the ocean is expected to
double in the next 15 years, and by 2050, there could be more plastic than fish
in the sea (by weight).

It can take upwards of 500 years to completely decompose if
it is end up to landfill.This is huge consumption of plastic bubble sheet which can
be replaced with another environment friendly option of “Paper bubble wrap”.Also, most of the countries already banned plastic packaging,
we need to switch quickly with this solution for packaging of products. There
are many benefits of using paper bubble wrap:1-     
Bubble wrapping paper is a lighter option
than standard bubble wrap, which may significantly increase the weight of
goods.2-      In
contrast to conventional plastic bubble wrap, which frequently needs sticky
tape to keep wraps around objects secure, bubble packing paper usually has
self-sealing mechanisms or interlocking tabs.3-      Paper
bubble wrap is a more environmentally responsible option because it is
biodegradable and frequently created from recycled materials.

paper bubble can be produced on demand with portable machine and paper roll
inhouse.",Greenball,,Raychem RPG,Yes,,No,"At present at our GMD-IP plant, we are using plastic bubble
sheet for packing of products and consumption of bubble sheet roll (2 meter wide)
is approx. 10000 meters per year.

It is consumption of only one plant. At different plants if

In view of the difference in the actual Soil Data at all 4 legs, while driving,   Spun Piles used to terminate at premature depths  than the depth worked out through the designs based on the SI reports of the centre Peg . Accordingly we would end up driving the requisite Piles as per the design  terminating at premature Depths in many locations .

First, entries are made in Excel files, including details such as the serial number of the part and size, HV and PD test results, and temperature and humidity readings. Next, report numbers (e.g., EHVCA-2425-0001) are generated sequentially for the financial year. To generate the RTR, a serial number from the Excel file is used with the ""Finish & Merge"" tool in Word, following a standard format. Once the RTR is generated, it is printed, physically signed, and scanned for record-keeping. A hard copy of the RTR is then submitted to the production team for inclusion in the kit. For issuing RTRs to customers, scanned files are searched by serial numbers, saved to another location, and merged as needed.                                                                                                                     Innovation Descriptions: Initially, testing entries are input into the software and submitted for approval via email. Once approved, the RTR can be generated effortlessly with a single click, complete with a digital signature. The RTR is then saved according to the actual serial number corresponding to the EHVCA parts for accurate record-keeping. This system allows for quick and efficient retrieval of multiple RTRs, minimising time spent on issuing them to customers.                                                                                                                            Benefits:             1.

Manual monitoring and updating the deployment process can be distracting and prone to human error.

evolving landscape of financial transactions, the need for more efficient,
secure, and standardized methods for exchanging financial messages is
paramount. Currently, the financial industry relies on several messaging
standards (such as SWIFT MT, MX, and others) which are often fragmented,
leading to inefficiencies, errors, and higher operational costs. Furthermore,
legacy messaging systems do not fully support modern digital transaction
requirements such as real-time processing, enhanced data transparency, and
interoperability across different financial institutions and markets.

ISO
20022, a globally recognized standard for electronic data interchange between
financial institutions, aims to address these challenges by providing a more
consistent, structured, and extensible format for financial messaging. However,
while ISO 20022 has been gaining adoption, there remain significant barriers to
its universal integration, such as:
Key Challenges in Adopting ISO 20022 in the Payment Industry 


 Lack of Awareness and
     Understanding:
     Many financial institutions and stakeholders remain unfamiliar with the
     ISO 20022 standard and its benefits, hindering adoption.
 Integration Challenges: Transitioning from legacy
     systems (such as SWIFT MT) to ISO 20022 often involves complex integration
     processes, leading to significant implementation costs and operational
     disruptions.
 Interoperability Issues: Ensuring seamless
     communication between institutions using different messaging standards, as
     well as integrating legacy systems, requires robust translation and
     mapping solutions.
 Regulatory Compliance: Many regions and countries
     have their own regulations for financial messaging, making it difficult to
     ensure that ISO 20022 implementations adhere to specific local
     requirements while maintaining global interoperability.

have widespread and costly consequences for organizations. Non-compliance often
leads to significant financial repercussions, including fines, lawsuits, and
increased insurance premiums, with global fines for GDPR violations alone
surpassing €4 billion since its implementation in 2018.
Reputational damage from incidents like data breaches can erode trust and
credibility, with studies showing that 46% of consumers avoid companies
with a history of mishandling data. Operational risks such as fraud, data
leaks, or safety violations further disrupt business continuity. Unclear or
inconsistently enforced policies can demoralize employees, causing confusion
and diminishing trust in leadership. Additionally, industries like healthcare
and finance face heightened regulatory risks, where policy lapses can result in
license revocation, criminal charges, or even business closures. The cumulative
impact highlights the need for stringent policy adherence and proactive compliance
mechanisms to mitigate risks and maintain organizational integrity.

 

Though the enterprises keep on sharing
various training sessions, assessments and other there is no impactful way of
conveying the message – people do fail to adhere many a times due to
unavailability of real-world scenarios and what if we are part of such impacts.
Experience of failure makes someone more cautious to follow than read through
documents.

Challenge: Traditional API validation testing for network products is a manual, time-consuming process.  It often has limited scope, missing edge cases and leaving security vulnerabilities undetected.

Focus Areas: Mutation Testing | Property-Based Testing | Fuzz Testing

Mutation Testing: AI generates variations of valid API requests, testing how the API handles unexpected or malformed data. This identifies potential issues with data validation and processing logic.

Property-Based Testing: AI defines properties that API responses should adhere to (e.g., data format, consistency). Then, it automatically generates test cases to verify these properties hold true, ensuring API behavior aligns with expectations.

Intelligent Fuzz Testing: AI generates a vast array of valid but random API requests. This process uncovers edge cases and unexpected behaviors that traditional testing might miss, enhancing overall API robustness.

Implementation Plan:

1. API Specification & Data Model Analysis: Gather and analyze API specifications and data models to understand the API's expected behavior and data structures.
2. AI Model Training: Train AI models for mutation testing, property-based testing, and intelligent fuzzing based on the API specifications and data models.
3. Automated Test Generation & Execution: Leverage AI models to generate and execute comprehensive test cases, covering a wider range of scenarios than traditional methods.
4. Result Analysis & Prioritization: Utilize AI to analyze test results, prioritize critical issues, and minimize false positives.
5. Continuous Integration & Feedback Loop: Integrate AI-powered validation testing into the development lifecycle for continuous feedback and improvement.",Greenball, Sandeep Deshmukh (s.deshmukh4@zensar.com),Zensar Technologies,, Amit Bhonsle (amit.bhonsle@zensar.com),,,,,"Realised so far:{Amount,}","Projected Annually:{Amount,}",Yes,,

cables tightly, transmitting Suspension load to  support structures like poles or towers,
commonly in electrical system. Raychem’s existing Suspension clamp, designed
for a range of 25-95 sq. mm LVABC Cable which is capable of withstanding 12kN/1
min Tensile load whereas Customer WBSEDCL is having specific add-on requirement
of 15kN/1 min.

 

· Team has embarked on a challenging project aimed at achieving strength
in Suspension clamps with a specified timeline. Through various design
iteration, Vendor visit and numerous simulations, Team has managed to overcome this significant hurdle
and developed the Suspension clamp which demonstrated a load capacity of 18kN
for 1 minute, a substantial improvement from the previous 12kN for 1 minute. 

· Given the current order value of ?6.0 Cr, the implementation of these
improvements presents a significant revenue opportunity. This not only
underscores the project's success in terms of performance enhancement but also
highlights its financial benefits.",NeoStar,,Raychem RPG,Yes,,No,"Challenges
encountered and overcome:

1.    Design with existing future: Design
of new suspension clamp required existing features like Cable range optimization
as per NFC and EN standard.

 

2.  Customer specific requirement: RDSS
has a specific requirement of additional body strength requirement of 15kN/1
min against the existing 12kN/1 min.  The
same was achieved by doing detailed engineering and improving lower body
strength keeping any margin deterioration on mind.

 

3.     
Tool modification Challenges: Ensuring 1st time right validation of 18kN/1 min through
tool modification. Optimal modification is achieved by going through validation
of various concepts. 

4.     
Competitor benchmarking: We also analyzed a competitor's sample that was specified to meet the
required tensile strength of 15 kN/1 min.  However, the sample failed to achieve tensile
load at 14kN/1 min.

·
A tension clamp is a device used to hold and secure conductors or cables
tightly, transmitting mechanical tension to support structures like poles or
towers, commonly in electrical and telecom systems. Raychem’s existing tension
clamp, designed for a range of 90-159 sq. mm, presents several challenges that impact
on its performance and user satisfaction. 

·
The clamp's high
weight and cost make it less efficient, while its complex installation process
has led to frequent customer complaints and dissatisfaction. – Revenue Loss of Rs.
60,00,000 due to customer complaints. 

·
Additionally, numerous feedback reports from customers highlight the
need for significant improvements to address these issues. These challenges
emphasize the necessity for a redesigned solution that is lightweight,
cost-effective, and user-friendly to enhance operational efficiency and meet
customer expectations.

To address these challenges, the project introduces innovative clamping solutions.

Key features of the design include: 

1)     
Cable gripping with the Clamp: Introduce a serration
design over the wedges which ensure proper gripping without damaging outer
insulation of the cable.

2)     
Locking arrangement: Integrated locking arrangement provide inside the clamp so that Wedge movement
can be restricted during tensile stress. Additional back up locking also
provided at top of the wedge for additional protection.

3)     
Manufacturing process improvement: Costly and difficult machining
process was eliminated by casting process of external body which is achieved by
doing DOE (Design of experiment)

development.",Greenball, Kaushik Patel (kaushik_patel@raychemrpg.com),Raychem RPG,Yes,,No,"Challenges
encountered and overcome:

1.    
Design with existing future: The
design of new Tension Clamp required existing features like Cable range
optimization and Tensile Strength as per EN 50397-2 standard which was achieved
by lots of brainstorming and concept finalization.

 

2.    
Light Weight and Cost optimization: Unnecessary
components from the existing tension clamp were removed by DOE (Design of
experiments) which ultimately resulted in light weight and cost optimization.

Weight reduction: 2 kg 

Cost saving: Rs. 1026 / per clamp  

3.    
Gripping of MVCC Cable: Optimal gripping of the Cable is very critical and is required to give
a performance in extreme wind conditions. The same is achieved by going through
the validation of various concepts. 

4.    
Competitor benchmarking: We also analyzed a competitor's sample that was specified to meet the
required tensile strength of 28 kN. However, the sample failed to achieve this
performance at 24kN.

and transmit mechanical tension to support structures in electrical and telecom
systems. Raychem’s existing clamp, designed for 25-50 sq. mm LVABC cables, met
a tensile load capacity of 12kN/1 minute. However, to meet the specific
requirements of WBSEDCL, a higher capacity of 15kN/1 minute was needed.

· The team undertook a challenging project to enhance the clamp’s
performance while reducing its weight to achieve cost savings. Through
extensive design iterations, vendor collaboration, and advanced Finite Element
Analysis (FEA), a breakthrough was achieved. The new clamp now withstands a
load of 18kN/1 minute, surpassing both the previous design and WBSEDCL's
requirements. Additionally, the weight of the clamp was reduced by
approximately 40 grams without compromising its mechanical strength.

· This innovation not only meets the enhanced performance specifications
but also presents substantial financial benefits. For a current order value of ?6.5
crore, the improved design is projected to save ?51 lakh, underscoring
significant cost optimization.

· This project exemplifies the successful combination of engineering
ingenuity and cost-efficiency, ensuring enhanced product reliability while
delivering tangible financial gains to stakeholders.

Transformer, with dimensions of 6400 mm (L) x 2800 mm (W) x 3500 mm (H) and a
weight of 40 metric tons, from Sitarganj, Uttarakhand to Khungri, Nepal,
presented significant logistical challenges. This was a critical Over-Dimensional
Cargo (ODC) consignment, requiring specialized planning and coordination.

 

The primary obstacle was
the terrain. The route traversed hilly and narrow roads, which made the
movement of such a large and heavy transformer difficult. The narrow, winding
roads were often not wide enough to accommodate the oversized load, and sharp turns,
steep gradients, and unstable sections further compounded the difficulty.

 

Additionally, there was the
challenge of a lack of availability of specialized lowbed trailers in Nepal to
handle such large consignments. Lowbed trailers are typically required for
transporting heavy and oversized cargo to ensure stability and safe transport,
especially when crossing challenging terrain. The absence of these trailers in
Nepal meant that alternative solutions had to be devised to successfully move
the transformer from the Indian border to its final destination in Khungri.

 

In response to these
challenges, a comprehensive and multi-step logistics plan was developed. This
involved careful route mapping, coordination with local authorities for
necessary permissions, and the use of custom-built transport solutions. The
transportation team also employed expert maneuvering techniques to navigate the
difficult roads, ensuring the transformer was transported safely and
efficiently despite the logistical hurdles.",Equinox, Ankur Mangal (mangala01@kecrpg.com),KEC,No, Krishan Murari (thakralk@kecrpg.com),No,"Challenges
and Mitigation Plans: We encountered several uncertainties and challenges in Nepal,
which are outlined below:

 

a)      Insufficient weight
carrying capacity of Nepali Vehicles: A major hindrance in Nepal is
that Nepali vehicles lack the appropriate weight-carrying capacity. As a
result, the insurance team does not permit loading cargo onto these vehicles
due to safety concerns.
Solution: We
identified an Indian vehicle with the necessary capacity and obtained approval
for its movement within Nepal. The driver of this vehicle has extensive
experience in transporting heavy ODC cargo through Nepal’s challenging road conditions.

b)      Modifications to be made
to the vehicle platform according to Cargo and Route: A major obstacle in Nepal is the
short turning radius, which requires the vehicle platform to be no longer than
16 feet for our cargo.

Solution: We specially fabricated lowbed trailers using high-tension
steel, specifically designed for ODC movements in Nepal. This trailer was built
to support the weight of the cargo while maintaining a short length.
Additionally, we developed a system that allows the rear axle to be shifted
back to accommodate the cargo and meet the insurance agency requirements.

c)      Narrow Roads / Limited
Turning Radius: Due to the mountainous terrain, the width of the road is very
narrow at various points, and there are several hairpins, U-shaped, and
V-shaped curves that require the highest level of caution to navigate.

Solution: To overcome this limitation, our escort team, in
coordination with the police authorities, stopped traffic from both directions
at various sections of the road to allow our ODC cargo to pass while
maintaining the transport schedule. Additionally, civil work was carried out at
several locations to widen the turning radius. With the vast experience of
selected drivers and escort team, we successfully managed to navigate these
challenges.

d)      Local Issues: In Nepal, local
authorities such as the Nagarpalika and residents play a significant role. Many
people do not allow heavy ODC cargo to pass through their villages, citing
concerns that it may damage their property, roads, or infrastructure.

Solution: We sought
support from Nepal Police Authorities, local leaders, and our on-ground team to
ensure the safe and peaceful movement of the cargo, addressing all concerns and
maintaining a smooth operation.

e)      Site entry gate issues: The turning radius at
the site entry gate was insufficient for our lowbed vehicle to enter the
premises.

Solution: The site team
carried out civil work to level the uneven roads and increase the width of the
gate, allowing smooth entry for the vehicle.

f)        Insurance Coverage: Due to the unavailability of suitable
vehicles in Nepal, it was challenging to address unforeseen circumstances, as
we required full coverage under the marine insurance policy.

Solution: We held several joint meetings with the insurance agency
and, after thorough discussions, agreed to modify the vehicle according to the
consignment specifications. The necessary amendments were made to the existing
insurance policy with the consent of our insurance team",,"Qualitative Impact:{Qualitative Impact,Internal},{Remarks,<p class=""MsoNormal""><b><span>The successful transportation of the 30 MVA Power Transformer from&#10;Sitarganj, Uttarakhand to Khungri, Nepal, had a profound positive impact on the&#10;internal team and the organization as a whole.

Businesses struggle to identify emerging trends, assess market sentiment, and predict dynamic demand patterns due to the lack of real-time, unified data. Additionally, the process of aggregating data from disparate sources, normalizing it, and extracting actionable insights is time-consuming and resource-intensive, leading to missed opportunities and inefficiencies. Solution: Leveraging Gen AI for Real-Time Insights and Predictions  With advancements in generative AI and real-time data processing, businesses can now overcome these challenges with remarkable precision and speed. By integrating Gen AI ecosystems with web scraping, APIs, and external data sources, organizations can collect, normalize, and analyze information in real time. Gen AI models like GPT-4 can then synthesize this data, generate predictive insights, and recommend personalized lead-generation strategies based on evolving market conditions. This approach not only enhances accuracy but also automates the decision-making process, reducing manual effort and enabling businesses to respond proactively to market changes. This Gen AI-powered solution not only enhances the precision of lead generation and demand prediction but also positions businesses to stay ahead of competitors by adapting to market dynamics in real time. The fusion of external data, advanced AI capabilities, and domain-specific insights creates a game-changing opportunity to redefine strategic planning and execution. This solution was implemented as a proof of concept for a leading retail insurance company, aiming to enhance customer service within the jewelry and insurance sectors. The approach involved scraping real-time data on high-priced jewelry items and store details, including pricing and locations. By aggregating this information, insurers could form seamless partnerships with jewelry retailers to offer bundled services, combining insurance coverage directly with high-value jewelry purchases.

free Ambernath Plant

In Off The Road (OTR) tyre manufacturing
plant, Naphtha is an essential material to facilitate tyre building process.
Naphtha called solution is used to ensure the good quality of green tyre in
Tyre building machines. It is used to allow tool surface to slip through
between Tyre and Drum surface.



From the inception of Ambernath plant,
plant management team had decided to go Naphtha free process and that called
for great amount of challenge in tyre building process. We started facing tool
slippage in both operations  namely bead
stitching and turn down. Incident of tool slippage led to carcass scrap and
machine down time. This also called for frequent machine maintenance and spare
change. Carcass scrap increased to 0.06 % and machine down time increased to 70
hours per month. This hampered machine efficiency by 2%.



Team reduced this incidents through
frequent machine setting changes and increase in Time based spare replacements.
But still, we could not eliminate the incidents completely.



Need an Unique and Innovative solution

We contacted subject experts of tyre
building machines across CEAT plants and other companies. They also mentioned
the similar problems in OTR tyre building machine. Then team came
up with idea
of new tool with bell curve to eliminate slippage in operations. The idea
originated from the shift of point stitching to surface stitching. 

Bead stitching operation should be done
through surface stitching for avoiding tool slippage and turn down operation
should be supported by reciprocating motion to ensure no damage of machine
parts.",Darwin," Ajit Chavan (ajit.chavan@ceat.com), Milind Patil (milind.patil@ceat.com)",CEAT,Yes,,No,"Challenges 1. How to design Two- piece Tool
reciprocating motion?

It was essential to design two
piece tool
for the expected results because Turn down operation should be done front disc
and bead stitching operation should be done by other disc. The challenge in
this design was to accommodate both disc on the same shaft.

How
did we do it?  

We installed the front and back disc on
the same shaft with stepped shaft which can be assembled from one side of the
shaft. Both disc are mounted on separate set of bearings to allow them rotate
independently.



2.
How to accommodate tool gap with Reciprocating motion?

This tool is a part of back stitcher
assembly. It is mainly used for stitching operations on tyre for various
components like bead, rim strip, ply and turn down operation. This causes heavy
load reactions tools and mounting shaft. This heavy load leads to machine parts
failures like bend tool, bend mounting shaft. This results in gap between tool
and drum in all directions and maintenance takes 8 hours
time.

How
did we do it?

Reciprocating motion of 10 mm was
required on the tool to accommodate for the gap between drum and tool. This was
done using compression spring with accurate stiffness. Spring length and
stiffness was achieved through multiple trials on the machine and overall
dimension check.



3. Tool
Change-Recipe Change

Change in tool design would require the
change in recipe settings on all the SKUs. This would take the enormous time in
set up change and would also bring down the efficiency of machines.

How
did we do it?

We kept the overall tool length same as
the old one so that the overall positioning of stitcher does not disturb. We
provided trainings to all the maintenance engineers about the change in how
stitching settings should be carried out. This activity is done once for all

This idea is to build as a service platform that helps to fast track AI infused digital journeys with AI on edge. Lego blocks will focus on the following: 1. Design Thinking for AI-Driven InterfacesEmpathy First: Understand the end-user needs, frustrations, and expectations from an AI system.Co-Design: Collaborate with users to prototype interfaces that make AI features accessible and valuable.2. Integrating Explainability and TransparencyExplainability by Design: Include components like visualizations, plain-language explanations, or model insights so users understand how AI arrived at a result.Confidence Scores: Display confidence levels for predictions or recommendations to manage user expectations.Audit Trails: Provide access to decision logs for regulatory compliance and user trust.Example: AI tools in healthcare display the reasoning behind diagnoses to ensure doctors trust the AI.3. Bridging Usability and FunctionalitySeamless Onboarding: Offer tutorials and guided experiences to help users adapt to AI capabilities.Real-Time Feedback: Build interactive UIs where users can see immediate impacts of their inputs or corrections.Customization: Allow users to tweak preferences for AI behavior.4. Supporting Adaptive and Pro-active systems:Adaptive UI: Create interfaces that learn from user behavior and offer personalized suggestions.Proactive Recommendations: Design for proactive rather than reactive interfaces, where AI predicts user needs.5. Embedding Feedback LoopsFeedback Widgets: Allow users to rate or provide comments on AI outputs.Data Refinement: Feed this feedback into retraining cycles for the AI models.Active Learning: UI elements can let users flag corrections (e.g., marking emails as spam) that improve the model.6. Emphasis on Accessibility and InclusivityAccessible Design: Ensure UIs are accessible to users with disabilities (e.g., screen readers, keyboard navigation).Multi-Modal Interactions: Support voice, touch, and text-based inputs to cater to diverse user needs.Globalization: Build interfaces with multilingual and culturally adaptive design.This will help us to build more digital platforms on different channels and enhance the user accessibility. ",Greenball, Nagendra Mirajkar (nmirajkar@zensar.com),Zensar Technologies,Yes,,Yes,TBD,,"Qualitative Impact:{Qualitative Impact,External}","Realised so far:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}","Projected Annually:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}",Yes,20,

effective and smartly Progress trackable project management is crucial for
organizational success. We can use Microsoft Teams Planner- based robust
solution to streamline project planning, collaboration, and execution. By incorporating automation through the updates feature, Project Teams can further
enhance productivity, transparency, and team cohesion.

 

Idea Overview: The core idea is to integrate Microsoft Teams Planner
into the daily workflow of ‘IT Infra Support Teams’. Transforming similarly to how
other Development projects are managed from inception to completion phase. By
utilizing Planner’s intuitive interface, powerful features, and automation
capabilities ‘IT Infra Support Team’ can also achieve better coordination,
track progress in real-time, and ensure timely delivery of project milestones.We request you to go through the attached documents for your detailed overview:1.

Resistance
to Change: Adjustment may be difficult to shift
from ‘Existing tools & Process in place’ - Comprehensive training and
highlighting the new system's benefit will encourage Team members.

2.      Integration Issues: Current ITSM tool integration and
workflows may be complex. Planning a phased integration approach and getting support
from SME’s will help here.

3.      Data Migration: From the existing tool data migration may
be error-prone activity. Using automated tools & conduction via testing
will ensure integrity.

4.     
Customization
Needs: The default templates and planner may
not meet all requirements. Customized suitable Planner and automation Workflow
effort will be required.

5.      Automation Complexity: If
limited experience in automation tools, complex workflow creation may take
time. Starting with simple flow automation and then trying to integrate further
complex tools may increase Team confidence. 

6.     
User
Training and Adoption: It
may be difficult to achieve proficiency in using Planner for all Team members
at a time. Availing ongoing training sessions, creation of User Guides, and
availability of instant support will be beneficial for Team members. 

7.      Monitoring and Maintenance: It
requires monitoring and maintenance to ensure automation Workflows are working correctly
and as per desired changes. Assigning a dedicated ownership to an individual
will help to oversee and make required adjustments of observed automation WorkFlow.
 

8.      Security and Compliance: Automated processes must comply with the organization’s security policies and industry regulations. Implementing robust security and conducting regular audits helps to maintain compliance.

9.      Scalability: As per Team’s growth with time the Planner
and Automation should handle increased workloads. It’s important to design
scalable and periodic reviews of automation workflows for performance to support
and accommodate growth is essential.

Feedback and Continuous Improvement: Collecting feedback to improve the system can be
challenging. Availing exchange of input and suggestions sharing loop within
the team can improve the adopted solution in the long run.",,"Qualitative Impact:{Qualitative Impact,Internal},{Remarks,<div><ol><li>Encourages Default transparency: &#8220;What, When, Who, Why, How, Where&#8221; Can be self-identifiable to all Team Members and concerned stakeholders right from beginning to completion for each Task OR activity defined.</li><li>Cost Savings and Revenue Impact: Efficiently managed time of each resource and reduction in long daily stand-up meetings/calls can be cut short within a few minutes.

important property required for tyre inner-liners in tubeless tyres and in the
tubes of the tube tyres used in passenger car types, trucks, buses, two or
three-wheelers, etc. Isobutylene-isoprene rubber (IIR), and their halogen
derivatives, brominated and chlorinated isobutylene-isoprene; (BIIR and CIIR)
are generally used for tyre inner liners and in tubes due to their ability to
maintain superior air retention, ensuring prolonged optimal tyre performance
and safety. This study delves into the development of computational models to
understand the rate of air permeation through these butyl rubbers in a
comparative manner using molecular dynamics simulations. Through advanced
molecular modeling techniques and comprehensive all-atom molecular dynamics
simulations, we meticulously analyze molecular structures of BIIR, CIIR and IIR
rubbers and gas transportation through these polymers. Our computational
investigations highlight that CIIR has distinct structural features,
particularly the presence and positioning of chlorine atoms, which
significantly enhance its ability for slowing down the rate of transport of gas
molecules (O2, N2 and air). The overall trend of gas
transmission rate among these polymers is IIR > BIIR > CIIR which is
successfully validated with experimental result. These simulations provide deep
insights into the molecular mechanisms that govern CIIR’s superior barrier
properties, revealing how variations in initial conditions, available free
volume, and the interaction of functional groups with gas molecules contribute
to its enhanced air retention properties. By elucidating these transportation
phenomena, this research not only advances our fundamental understanding of
rubber material science but also underscores the pivotal role of selecting
suitable polymer wherever barrier property of tyre and tube are required through

In uniformity process two symbols ( Red and yellow) are marked on tyre to signify High point and low point. Recently OEM Maruti Suzuki asked CEAT if two red and two yellow dots can be marked on tyre sidewall to be on safer side if one dot fades away. SO the objective was to mark double uniformity marking as per OE specifications PCR tyre within the cycle time of a single marking process, without necessitating additional setup costs or manpower. Background : Existing setup currently allows for single marking only, where red dots signify the high point and yellow dots signify the low point of the tire. Current Situation : Four pins are affixed to a block with four cylinders. During the tire balancing process, the tire is affixed to a rim and rotated accordingly. Sensors analyze the tire grade and designate the suitable cylinder. Each cylinder is equipped with a distinct die shape tailored for different grades (A, B, E, Triangle). The chosen cylinder then imprints the corresponding shape onto the tire surface.Problem : Initially CFT tried to implement double marking by tweaking the program to meet the OE requirement, but it slowed down the cycle time and required an extra uniformity machine to mark this double dot and cost of same was 90 Million Indian rupees which is a heavy investment to be thought of and can't be done immediatelySolution : To achieve double marking with the existing system, an intermediate solution is programming the system to execute two punching actions on the tire. This ensures that the marking is applied twice without requiring additional hardware modifications. The Uniformity block hardware was modified from 04 pins to 08 pins to accommodate the two solid markings (Red & Yellow) on the tyre. This modification was done with cost of 80K Indian rupees only.The Uniformity Marking pin block has been enhanced from 4 pins to 8 pins to facilitate the simultaneous punching of dual markings on the tire without extending the cycle time.v Double Marking method : The block has been expanded on both sides to accommodate two stamps for yellow and red dot marking. Each side stamp is now connected by caps for synchronized actuation. Circular stamp dies are installed for Grade A tires. Two horizontal pistons enable lateral movement of the block as needed. The extended stamps pass beneath fixed cylinders to ensure double stamping. Furthermore, an additional heating system has been implemented for the extra stamps, with RTD for temperature monitoring.",Darwin, Sajeesh Kumar Kandambeth (sajeesh.kumar@ceat.com),CEAT,No, Nidil C P (nidil.cp@ceat.com),No,1.

yet. Services provided but not billed yet. It gets recorded as assets in the Trial
Balance. With this we can track the billing to be done to customers and cash
flow management.

When revenue is generated before invoice / billing, revenue balance is
created but not billed. So, Oracle uses Unbilled Receivables (UBR), as there is
no invoice balance. Whenever revenue line created, amount and one leg of
accounting is posted to UBR (Unbilled Receivables)

What is UER: Revenue that has been received but not earned. Advance received
from customer, Annual subscriptions, pre-paid amount by customer as per the
contract. It gets recorded as liability side of the trial balance. It is
important to review the work to be done for customer. When invoice / billing is
generated before revenue accrual, invoice balance is created. So, Oracle uses
Unearned Revenue (UER), as there is no revenue balance. Whenever an invoice is
created, amount and one leg of accounting is posted to UER (Unearned Revenue)
in fusion.

The UER and UBR gets knocked off when the other event is created and becomes
net to zero and the remaining amount (if any) will be posted to respective
accounts.

Making the UBR/UER to net zero and the remaining amount (if any) will be
posted to respective accounts is called Billing Offset feature in fusion
application. This activity is to be done contract wise and to be done in
every period.

There is no control over directing the amount to UBR/UER when the revenue or
invoice events are created depending on the business needs.

To have the UBR/UER balances report we need to run few processes in system.

We extract the data using API’s or we get some of the data as an extract from
Oracle fusion, we load the extracted data in Data warehouse. On top of that we
have built a complex procedure which calculate balance amount against each
contract and store the result in an output table. Based on output table we
built UBR/UER report using Java stack which displays the balance against the
contract as and when required by business.

Traditional authentication methods like passwords and PINs are vulnerable to breaches and fraud, placing both the institution and customers at risk. The lack of a unified system results in inefficiencies, higher operational costs, and decreased customer satisfaction.Solution:Biometric Financial Identity (BFI) system—a biometric-based identity platform tailored for financial institutions. This innovative solution utilizes a combination of fingerprint, iris, and voice recognition to create a unique, secure identity for each customer. By integrating with a central financial KYC hub, the BFI system allows customers to undergo the KYC process once, eliminating the need for repetitive verification when accessing multiple products or services within the institution.The BFI system also replaces traditional passwords and PINs for transaction authorization and account access. Customers can securely authenticate themselves across all banking systems using their biometrics, enhancing security and simplifying the user experience.Use Case 1: Seamless Access to Multiple Banking ServicesA customer completes the KYC process once using the BFI system. Their biometric identity allows immediate access to various bank products—such as loans, credit cards, and investment accounts—without repeating verification steps. This streamlines onboarding for new services, enhancing convenience and reducing onboarding time.Use Case 2: Secure Transaction AuthorizationWhen conducting high-value transactions, customers authorize payments using their biometric identity—fingerprint, iris, or voice recognition—instead of passwords or PINs. This adds an extra layer of security, reduces fraud risk, and simplifies the user experience by eliminating the need to remember multiple authentication codes.It includes features like - Unified Biometric Authentication: Utilizes fingerprint, iris, and voice recognition to provide secure, password-free access across all banking and insurance services, replacing traditional authentication methods.Centralized KYC Integration: Stores customer verification data in a central hub, eliminating the need for repeated KYC processes when accessing different products within the institution.Seamless Service Access: Allows customers to instantly access multiple financial products—like loans, credit cards, and investment accounts—without additional verification steps, enhancing convenience.Secure Transaction Authorization: Enables biometric authorization for transactions, adding an extra layer of security and reducing the risk of fraud by ensuring that only the account holder can authorize activities.Multi-Modal Biometric Options: Offers multiple biometric modalities to accommodate all users, ensuring accessibility and high authentication accuracy regardless of physical limitations.",NeoStar,,Zensar Technologies,No, Ayut Poreddiwar (a.poreddiwar@zensar.com),Yes,Data Privacy and Security: Protecting sensitive biometric data from breaches.System Integration: Integrating the BFI system with existing legacy systems and platforms.User Adoption and Trust: Overcoming customer concerns regarding biometric data usage.Regulatory Compliance: Navigating varying regulations across jurisdictions.Biometric Accuracy and Accessibility: Ensuring high accuracy and accommodating users who may have difficulties with certain biometrics.,,"Qualitative Impact:{Qualitative Impact,External},{Remarks,<div><b>Reduced Onboarding Time:&#160;</b><span>Up to 60% reduction in customer onboarding time.</span></div><div>Benefit: Accelerates time-to-service, leading to quicker revenue generation and improved customer satisfaction.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Cost Savings in KYC Processes:&#160;</b><span>Up to 50% reduction in KYC processing costs.</span></div><div>Benefit: Significant operational cost savings by streamlining and centralizing the KYC process.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Decrease in Fraudulent Transactions:&#160;</b><span>Up to 70% reduction in fraud related to identity theft.</span></div><div>Benefit: Saves potentially millions annually in fraud losses and enhances overall security.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Increased Customer Retention:&#160;</b><span>25% improvement in customer retention rates.</span></div><div>Benefit: Higher lifetime customer value and increased cross-selling opportunities.</div>}","Realised so far:{Unit,INR},{Amount,}","Projected Annually:{Unit,INR},{Amount,},{Type,Cost Saving}",Yes,95,

of the Innovation

This innovative
approach focuses on repurposing waste concrete generated on construction sites
to create sustainable, useful products—flower pots and slippers for stacking
TMT bars. Waste concrete is typically a byproduct of construction processes
like slab concreting or concrete discharge during TM hopper operations, which,
if left unmanaged, can pose environmental challenges such as soil contamination
and drainage blockages. By transforming this waste into practical items, we can
reduce the environmental impact of waste concrete while providing functional
products for the construction site.

Steps for
Implementation


 Collection of Waste Concrete
 
  Identify and set up designated
      areas for collecting waste concrete generated during slab concreting, TM
      hopper discharges, and other construction activities.
  Ensure that the waste concrete is
      segregated from other site debris and contaminants.
  Implement a collection system that
      minimizes spillage and allows easy transportation of the concrete to the

 Design and Prototyping
 
  Flower Pots: The flower pots will be designed
      with drainage holes and aesthetically pleasing shapes, making them ideal
      for gardening. They will be light enough for easy handling, yet durable
      enough for outdoor use.
  Slippers for Stacking TMT Bars: The slippers will be designed to
      prevent direct contact between the TMT bars and the ground, minimizing
      corrosion risk. They should be easy to stack and move, ensuring minimal
      wastage and better organization on-site.
 
 Quality Control
 
  Regular testing of the strength
      and durability of the flower pots and slippers will be carried out to
      ensure they meet the required standards for functionality and safety.
 
 Distribution and Usage
 
  Once the products are ready, they
      will be distributed and used on-site. The flower pots can be used for
      landscaping and enhancing the aesthetics of the construction site, while
      the slippers will be deployed for stacking TMT bars and organizing
      materials efficiently.Environmental

      debris from the site to ensure a clean foundation.Used the excavated soil to build up
      the edges of the pond and create berms to contain water.

We
currently use an Email Support Platform where employees send
emails for various concerns, including HR issues, Mediclaim, investments, bill
reimbursements, Tax/Investment, leaves, hardware issues, and IT-related
problems. This process is time-consuming, involves long waiting periods, and
results in an overwhelming number of emails to the respective departments.

Proposed Solution/Idea:

To streamline this process, we propose implementing an Zen
Help-AI bot that emphasizes quick and real-time solutions. This AI bot
will:


 Save
     time by providing immediate access to the right point of contact
     (SPOC).
 Reduce
     unnecessary email traffic.


Benefits:


 Employees
     will have their concerns addressed in real-time.
 Increased
     employee satisfaction.
 Reduced
     number of requests sent via email.
 This
     streamlined approach will enhance efficiency and improve the overall
     employee experience.


How Zen Help AI Bot will Work/Implementation: -



1. Information Ingestion: First, We will input all relevant
information into the AI Bot, including SPOCs, available processes/Knowledge
Base, and URLs etc.
2.Raising Concerns: Once Live, Employees will raise their concerns via
chat with the AI Help Bot.
3.Keyword Identification: The bot will identify keywords from the raised
concern and search its stored information (knowledge management, links, SPOCs
etc.
4.Providing Answers: The bot will provide an answer to the raised
concern.
5.Feedback Mechanism: The bot will ask if the employee is satisfied
(using a thumbs up/thumbs down system)
6.Connect to Live Advisor/SPOC: If the employee presses thumbs
down, the AI Bot will connect them to a live advisor to address the concern.
7. Concern Resolved: Once Concern is addressed by provided information
or by connecting Live Advisor, it will marked as Resolved.

This process ensures efficient and effective resolution of Email Support Process.",Darwin, Dipali Belsare (dbelsare@zensar.com),Zensar Technologies,Yes,,Yes,"As this is an Idea, we might face challenges Initially, regards to

ensuring optimal input for accurate detection.

 Object Detection Model:

An object detection model is employed to obtain bounding box coordinates for essential
cheque elements, including:

Payee Name

Amount (in words and figures)

Signature

Date

Cheque Number

Bank Information

Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS):

NMS filters overlapping bounding boxes based on Intersection over Union (IoU) and confidence
scores, retaining only the most relevant detections to enhance accuracy.

Validation and Classification:

The system verifies the authenticity of detected elements by checking formats and identifying
duplicates. A signature classification model is used to classify signatures as original or fraudulent, enhancing the reliability of the cheque validation and fraud detection.

Supply Chain departments, overall performance often suffers due to inadequate
interaction between functional areas, leading to the following challenges: 
 Lack
     of Real Time Data: Without the real-time data sharing across
     functions, identifying and responding to disruption becomes challenging,
     leading to delays and inefficiencies.
 Siloed
     Operations: Functional areas operate independently, creating
     information silos that hinder collaboration and comprehensive supply chain
     oversight.
 Inefficient
     Decision-Making: Limited visibility restricts informed
     decision-making, making it difficult to anticipate issues and implement
     preventive measures promptly.
 Increased
     Risk of Stockouts or Overstocks: Inadequate coordination can result in
     imbalanced inventory levels, causing either stockouts or excess inventory.
 Poor
     Supplier and Demand Management: Disconnected systems impede accurate
     demand forecasting and supplier coordination, affecting supply chain
     reliability.

These legacy systems, often burdened with technical debt and fragile from years of quick fixes, are not only costly to maintain but also hinder business agility. The scenario is further complicated by the impending retirement of a significant portion of the skilled workforce that has the knowledge to maintain these systems, as well as the inadequate technical documentation that makes knowledge transfer, mostly through person-to-person, expensive and inefficient.At the same time, demand for mainframe modernization is growing, driven by the need for streamlined applications that enhance agility and mitigate continuity risks. However, these projects are notoriously complex, with a 74% failure rate among organizations attempting them. Recent advances in technology, partnerships with Cloud Service Providers, usage of hybrid cloud environments, as well as incremental modernization strategies, offer more viable and less risky pathways to modernization.There's a growing recognition of AI's potential to address these challenges, offering promising solutions for automated code conversion, retro-documentation, and testing processes in mainframe modernization.Solution:  ZenMod is generative AI-assisted accelerator built to accelerate the mainframe application lifecycle and streamline modernization at lower cost and with less risk than today’s alternatives. The accelerator integrates with various industry standard tools and supports the end-to-end application developer lifecycle with capabilities for application discovery and analysis, R-lane assessment, code explanation, automated code refactoring, COBOL to Java transformation, and validation.Use Cases:1.        Deep analysis to visualize and assess key programs and dependencies2.        Rule based engine to assess complexity, R-Lane analysis and TCO calculation3.        Leverage Gen AI to explain and document COBOL and JCL in natural language.4.        Gain agility by automatically refactoring into more modular business services.5.        Leverage generative AI to transform refactored COBOL code into object-oriented Java code.6.        Use automated testing to ensure semantic equivalence between refactored COBOL code and newly transformed Java code. ",NeoStar,,Zensar Technologies,Yes,,Yes,"Mainframe modernization continues to pose significant challenges.
